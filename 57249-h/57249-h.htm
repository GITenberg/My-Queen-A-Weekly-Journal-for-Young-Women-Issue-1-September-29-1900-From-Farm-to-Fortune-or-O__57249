<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE DAISY CHAIN.</small></h3>

<p>There was hardly a ripple on the sultry
air as Marion Marlowe walked slowly along
the dusty country road picking a daisy
here and there and linking them together
in an artistic manner.</p>

<p>When the chain was finished she swung
it lightly in her hand, notwithstanding the
fact that each link held one of her heart
secrets interwoven in the form of a wish, as
she fashioned the frail necklace.</p>

<p>She paused for a moment upon the brow
of the steep hill behind her father’s farm,
and pushing the gingham sunbonnet back
from her face, took her usual evening glance
over the surrounding country.</p>

<p>“Same old hills! Same old trees!” she
whispered irritably. “And always that hideous
old Poor Farm staring one in the face!
Oh, I’m just sick of country life and a
horrid farm! Why couldn’t I have been
born something besides a farmer’s daughter?”</p>

<p>The view which Marion gazed upon was
not altogether unlovely, but the hills were
steep and the pastures were scorched and
the Poor Farm, always a blot upon the
peaceful picture, stood out with aggressive
ugliness in the keen glow of sunset.</p>

<p>Just over the brow of a low hill rose a
curling line of smoke. It came from the
chimney of the little station where the Boston
and New York Express stopped morning
and evening, the only connecting link
between them and civilization.</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe was seventeen and
superbly handsome. Her twin sister was
fairer, more childish and a trifle smaller, but
both were far more beautiful than most
country maidens.</p>

<p>As Marion spoke, her gray eyes darkened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>until they were almost black, and the ungainly
sunbonnet could not begin to cover
her hair, which was long and silky and a
rich, ripe chestnut.</p>

<p>Turning her back upon the Poor Farm,
which always offended her, Marion suddenly
gave vent to her mood in a most extraordinary
manner.</p>

<p>Posing on the very crest of the hill with
her shoulders thrown back haughtily, she began
singing a quaint air which was full of
solemn melody, and as she sang her eyes
glistened and her cheeks grew even redder,
for Marion loved the sound of her beautiful
voice—she knew well that she was a
magnificent singer, and might readily be forgiven
for glorying in her superb natural endowments.</p>

<p>“And to think it should all be wasted
here!” she muttered as she finished.</p>

<p>There was a scornful wave of her hand
as she indicated the inoffensive country.</p>

<p>She pulled on her sunbonnet with a sudden
jerk.</p>

<p>“What could she do?” She asked the
question hopelessly, and the very trees
seemed to mock her with their rustling whispers.</p>

<p>She could do nothing! She was only a
farmer’s daughter! She must bake, roast and
boil, weed the garden, tend the chickens, and
last but not least, she must marry some stupid
farmer and live exactly the life that her
mother had lived before her.</p>

<p>“I won’t do it!” she cried, angrily, when
she had reached this point in her thoughts.</p>

<p>“I’ll never submit to it! Never! Never!
I will make a name somehow, somewhere,
some time! Do you hear me, you glorious
old sun? I will do it! I swear it!”</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse she lifted her hand
above her head. The setting sun threw a
shaft of light directly across her path which
clothed her in a shining radiance as her vow
was registered.</p>

<p>The sky was darkening when Marion
drew her sunbonnet on again and started
slowly down the hill toward her father’s pasture.</p>

<p>She let down the bars at the entrance to
the pasture lot easily with her strong, white
hands. There were five of the patient creatures
awaiting her coming. The sixth had
strayed a little, so she strolled about, calling
to it, through the straggling brush and
birches.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the unmistakable
patter of bare feet along the road; Marion
listened a moment and then went on with
her search.</p>

<p>“Move faster, there, Bert Jackson! What’s
the matter with ye, anyway?”</p>

<p>The words were shouted in a brutal voice
which Marion knew only too well to belong
to Matt Jenkins, the keeper of the Poor
Farm.</p>

<p>“I am moving as fast as I can,” answered
a boyish voice, “but my arm aches so badly
that I can hardly walk, Mr. Jenkins.”</p>

<p>“As if an ache in your arm hindered you
from walkin’ fast!” roared Matt Jenkins
again. “Faster, I say, or I’ll put the whip
on ye!”</p>

<p>There was no reply, only the hurried
tramp of bare feet in the road, but there
was a light crackle in the bushes of the pasture
lot as Marion hurried to the bars driving
the truant cow before her.</p>

<p>A group of nearly a dozen lads from the
Poor Farm were shuffling down the road.
They had been working about on various
farms through the day, and now were
“rounded up” like so many cattle by Matt
Jenkins, their keeper, and were being hurried
home under the constant goad of voice and
lash, the latter a cart whip of ugly dimensions.</p>

<p>Just as Marion reached the bars the squad
of boys came abreast of her, and one—a fine,
manly looking chap of seventeen or
eighteen—glanced quickly in her direction,
almost stopping short as he did so.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! Laggin’ ag’in, air ye, Bert
Jackson!” roared the keeper again. “There!
Take that fer yer stubbornness in not doin’
as I tell ye!”</p>

<p>The long lash circled through the air and
came down with a hiss that made Marion’s
blood run cold—but only for a minute.</p>

<p>The next instant she had darted straight
out into the road, and as the vicious whip
was raised for a second cut at the poor youth
she sprang at Matt Jenkins with the fury of
a panther—snatching the whip from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>hands and throwing it over the fence into
the pasture.</p>

<p>“How dare you, Mr. Jenkins!”</p>

<p>Marion’s eyes flashed like fire as she faced
him.</p>

<p>Her sunbonnet had fallen off and showed
her beautiful hair and rose-tinted features.
The daisy chain fell and was trampled under
her feet in the dust—the links which
bound her wishes were scattered and
broken.</p>

<p>“How dare you strike a poor orphan?” she
cried again. “You are a coward to strike
a boy! You ought to be kicked straight out
of your position, Matt Jenkins!”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’re mighty independent,
Marion Marlowe!” growled Matt Jenkins
angrily. “I’ll tell yer father of ye, Miss
High-flyer, an’ then we’ll see who gits the
lickin’.”</p>

<p>“My father will never whip me again, Mr.
Jenkins,” said the girl, almost sadly. “If he
does I’ll run away, even if I starve to death
in a big city.”</p>

<p>The boys were all staring at Marion now,
and as she looked at them she saw that
they sympathized fully with her sentiments.</p>

<p>“They don’t dare say so,” she thought, as
she caught their eager glances. “Poor boys,
they are actually envying me just because
I have a father!”</p>

<p>Out loud she said bitterly:</p>

<p>“I mean it, Mr. Jenkins, and you can tell
him I said so if you wish. I’m not a child
any longer, I’m over sixteen! As old as my
mother was when she was married,” she
added proudly.</p>

<p>“Here, Bill Vedder, go git me my whip,”
was the keeper’s only answer.</p>

<p>As the boy addressed started for the whip
Marion Marlowe walked directly up to Bert
Jackson.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with your arm, Bert?”
she asked very softly.</p>

<p>Bert’s lips tightened a little and his face
paled as he answered:</p>

<p>“It’s broke, I think,” he said in a whisper.
“I fell off the load and struck right on my
elbow, but Mr. Jenkins only laughed at me—he
wouldn’t let me see a doctor.”</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage, a cowardly outrage!”
cried Marion, hotly. “Oh, why am I not a
man so that I could do something to aid
you!”</p>

<p>The sensitive face was flushed with anger
now and the tears trembled on her lashes
as she turned toward Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>“His arm is broken,” she said, in an agonized
voice. “Oh, Mr. Jenkins, do hurry and
take him to a doctor!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” growled Mr. Jenkins, as he
strode forward and made a motion to grasp
Bert’s wounded arm.</p>

<p>“My God, don’t touch it!”</p>

<p>The boy shrank back with a cry of terror.</p>

<p>In an instant Marion was between them,
her voice ringing out like a bugle.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to hurt him, you monster!”
she cried furiously; “I won’t stand by
and see it done even if I am a girl! And
when I’m a woman I’ll have you put in
prison!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll help you do it, if I’m alive!”
cried Bert Jackson, recklessly; “but there
ain’t much doubt but what he’ll kill me now
for my arm hurts so bad that I can’t stand
him much longer!”</p>

<p>Marion stood like a statue as the group
passed down the road. Matt Jenkins looked
back at her once or twice, but his whip was
not raised while her eyes were upon him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE CITY BOARDER.</small></h3>

<p>When they were gone from her sight
Marion turned homeward.</p>

<p>The patient cows were well on their way,
so the young girl had nothing to do but follow
them.</p>

<p>As she came in sight of the low farm-house
where she was born she saw a girlish figure
coming swiftly toward her.</p>

<p>It was her twin sister, Dolores, or Dollie as
she was called, and at the very first glance
Marion could see that she was weeping.</p>

<p>In an instant she was running rapidly toward
her, and as they met she threw her arms
tenderly about her sister’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dollie? Has father been tormenting
you about Silas again?” she asked
breathlessly, at the same time brushing her
sister’s golden hair back from her brow with
a caressing motion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Dollie wiped her eyes and nodded her head
affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, Marion, he has, and I can’t stand it
much longer!” she cried, sobbingly. “He is
just nagging at me all the time, and, oh, he is
cruel, sister. Why, when I told him I did
not love Silas he just sneered at me as though
love was something that was not to be considered!”</p>

<p>“Poor father! It is little he knows of that
holy sentiment,” said Marion, sadly, “but go
on Dollie, what else did he say to you?”</p>

<p>A gleam of resentment shone in Dollie’s
blue eyes, for she was always more brave
when her sister’s arms were about her.</p>

<p>“Oh, he said I had defied him and that he
would punish me for it! That a man had a
right to do as he pleased with his own family,
and that girls like you and me did not have a
grain of sense about what was best for them!”</p>

<p>Marion’s gray eyes flashed as her sister
talked, but she walked slowly on and did not
interrupt her.</p>

<p>“Then he said that I would have a comfortable
home if I married Silas, and that I’d go
straight to destruction if he did not look out
for me!”</p>

<p>“How horrible!” burst out Marion. “And
to think he is our own father! Why isn’t he
content with one such experiment? Poor
sister Samantha, whom he forced to marry
Tom Wilders! I should think her miserable
life would be a warning to him! Oh, Dollie,
if we could only go away and earn our own
living. You can play the piano beautifully
and I can sing. If we could only go somewhere
and make our own way where we
should never bother father, I should be perfectly
happy!”</p>

<p>The beautiful face was radiant with eagerness
now, and some of her wonderful courage
seemed reflected upon Dollie’s more babyish
features.</p>

<p>“It would kill me to marry Silas!” she cried
with a shudder. “Father shall not force me
to do it, Marion, never!”</p>

<p>There was a close clasp of the arms about
each other’s waists as the two girls walked
on and Dollie’s golden head almost rested
upon her sister’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why, Marion, what do you think! He
tried to bribe me,” she added, suddenly. “He
said I could have grandma’s topazes the day I
was married to Silas.”</p>

<p>A look of disgust swept over Marion’s
face.</p>

<p>“As if those old earrings of grandma’s
could make up for such a crime! And it is a
crime to marry without love, my sister.”</p>

<p>A piteous sob broke from Dollie’s lips and
she moved a step away.</p>

<p>“There’s no help for it, Marion. He’ll
make me do it,” she cried. “He’ll ruin my
life just as he ruined Samantha’s, for, oh, it
will kill me to be tied down to the drudgery
of farm life forever, and especially with such
a man as Silas.”</p>

<p>“We must find some way to thwart him,”
said Marion, as she opened the gate that led
to the farm-house. “It is horrible to think of
such a thing. The idea of a man trying to get
rid of his own daughter, even selling her body
and soul, for that is exactly what it amounts
to. Silas Johnson isn’t a bad fellow, but he
is an awful bore. He isn’t much like what
we have dreamed of in the way of lovers.”</p>

<p>They had entered the dingy kitchen now
and closed the door behind them. There was
no one there, so they went on softly with
their confidences.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” said Dollie, smiling
brightly through her tears, as she recalled the
mental pictures of the gallant youths which
they had so often woven into the links of their
daisy chains, hoping that some day they
would come, like Cinderella’s Prince, and rescue
them from the drudgery of farm life,
which they hated.</p>

<p>“Our lovers must be all that is grand and
brave and true,” she cried excitedly. “They
must be of noble blood, like the knights in
the story books, who would risk their lives
for a maiden’s love and think no peril too
great to keep them from their trysts. Oh. I
have often dreamed of them, Marion, and
such beautiful dreams. It was like a glimpse
of bliss to be loved by such a lover.”</p>

<p>“And just think, Dollie, the world is full of
them,” cried Marion. “There really are
just such knights and they do kneel at the
feet of blushing maidens.”</p>

<p>“It makes me tremble with delight just to
think of it,” murmured Dollie. “Oh, Marion,
will I ever have a lover like that? One whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>slightest word will make me thrill with pleasure.
If we only lived in the city, darling.
But no one will ever come here. We will
just die longing for love and never, never
get it.”</p>

<p>“Mine was to have black eyes and brown
hair, and be very tall,” began Marion, wiping
her eyes, “and he was to be, oh, so gentle
and tender in his wooing, yet all the time as
brave and strong as a lion! Oh, my lover
was to be a perfect prince among men, and
we were to marry and live in a little paradise
of pleasure!”</p>

<p>Her cheeks were glowing as she finished
her impulsive speech, and radiant smiles were
dimpling her fair features.</p>

<p>“And mine was to have gray eyes; like
yours, Marion; and a big mustache, and—but,
oh, my goodness! Just look at who is
coming!”</p>

<p>Dollie finished abruptly, pointing out of
the window.</p>

<p>“It’s the man that mother said was looking
for board, I suppose,” said Marion
thoughtfully. “Father must have taken him
and he’s bringing him straight into the
kitchen.”</p>

<p>“He’s the handsomest man I ever saw!”
cried Dollie, springing up. “Quick! Marion,
we must tidy ourselves up a bit, dear! He
mustn’t think we are frights, even if we are
a farmer’s daughters!”</p>

<p>Farmer Marlowe introduced the girls with
an awkward wave of his hand.</p>

<p>“My darters, Mr. Lawson,” he said, with
an effort at politeness. Then leaving the
girls to entertain the new boarder, he strode
out of the room again to do the evening
milking.</p>

<p>The stranger, a man of thirty, of most
striking appearance, stood as if rooted to
the spot for at least a full moment after his
first sight of the girls.</p>

<p>Such beauty as this was rare in any place,
but finding it buried here in the wilderness
of rocks and sand, he could hardly believe
his senses for a minute.</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe rose politely, and offered
him a chair, which he accepted with such a
glance of admiration that she could not help
blushing.</p>

<p>“I am most fortunate in finding such desirable
quarters,” he said gallantly, “for I
had not dreamed of anything in the way of
society in this forlorn little village. You
see, I am a bit of an invalid, and the doctor
has sent me into the country to rest. Little
did I imagine that I should find angels to
minister to me! Which will explain, I trust,
any seeming rudeness in my manner.”</p>

<p>“We stared at you also,” said Marion, still
blushing, “but my sister and I have seen so
few gentlemen, Mr. Lawson, that we were
just as much surprised as you were.”</p>

<p>She tried to speak naturally, but her voice
trembled a little. There was a curious sensation
of anger thrilling every fibre of her
body.</p>

<p>The man’s dark eyes seemed reading her
soul. His penetrating glance annoyed and
irritated her.</p>

<p>What could it mean? She tried to think
calmly. No man whom she had met had
ever affected her so strangely.</p>

<p>“I hope I am somewhat different from
these townsmen of yours,” went on the man
smilingly, “no better perhaps, but a little less
boorish. It is a shame that such beauty as
this should be wasted upon them! Forgive
me for what seems to be flattery, but I must
speak honestly. You are both too beautiful
to be buried here! You should live in the
city, my dear young ladies!”</p>

<p>Marion bit her lips to control her resentment,
but before she could reply her mother
entered the kitchen and began preparations
for their homely supper.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>MARION PROVES HER INTUITIONS.</small></h3>

<p>The weeks passed swiftly at the Marlowe
farmhouse, for Mr. Lawson’s presence there
had broken the monotony. Not once during
his stay had Marion been able to shake off
her first impressions.</p>

<p>She dreaded him instinctively, and was ill
at ease in his presence.</p>

<p>There was a mystery about him which she
could not fathom—but her intuitions were
keen, and she decided to trust them.</p>

<p>Marion was too amiable to ordinarily
allow her feelings to be seen. Not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>to Dollie had she made full confession of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson’s attentions to her sister worried
her exceedingly—but with Silas Johnson
as the alternative, she was forced to be
silent.</p>

<p>One morning Marion took her churn out
under a big locust tree near the kitchen door
and was churning vigorously when she overheard
an astonishing conversation.</p>

<p>Silas Johnson and her father were just
around the corner of the house, but neither
knew of her presence or they would have
spoken more guardedly.</p>

<p>“I’ve sed it an’ I calkerlate I’ll stick ter
it,” her father said, sullenly. “Dollie shell
marry yew, Sile, so yew needn’t git up yewr
dander!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I ain’t got up no dander, Farmer
Marlowe,” was the reply; “but it’s high time
ther thing wuz done an’ settled, fer I’m
gittin’ a leetle tired of seein’ thet thar city
chap with Dollie. Yew know gals will be
gals, an’ ther ain’t much dependin’ on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ther city chap’s a-goin’ ter-morrer
ef thet’s what’s worryin’ yew,” replied the
farmer, quickly. “An’ as quick’s he’s gone,
I’ll hev it out with Dolly. It’s ther best
thing fer her an’ she’s got ter dew it.”</p>

<p>“Yew kin hev them papers back on our
weddin’ day,” said Silas, with a rasping
chuckle.</p>

<p>Marion held her breath. Here was a new
phase of the situation.</p>

<p>“Thankee, Sile, I’ll be plum’ glad tew git
’em, I kin tell yew!” said her father, sighing.
“Them air dog-goned papers hez worried me
like thunder, but ez yew say, it’ll be all
in the fambly when yew marry Dollie.”</p>

<p>Marion drew a long breath and grasped
the churn handle tighter. In another moment
the two men rose from their seats and
sauntered out to the garden, still talking seriously.</p>

<p>“So it is a business transaction of some
sort!” whispered Marion to herself.</p>

<p>“Pa owes Silas some money or something,
and he is going to settle it by giving
him Dollie!”</p>

<p>She rose from her stool, her face fairly
crimson with anger. As she turned to enter
the house she confronted Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>For just a second Marion hesitated to
tell her trouble to this man, then an uncontrollable
impulse made her turn to him
appealingly. She had forgotten all else but
her sister’s danger.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Lawson, I must tell you an awful
secret,” she cried, brokenly, “and oh, I
do hope you will be able to advise me—you
are wise and—and kind—I am sure that you
will help me. Father is in debt to Silas
Johnson, and Sile has made him promise that
Dollie shall marry him!”</p>

<p>The tears trembled on Marion’s lashes as
she said the words, and in her intense excitement
her dark eyes shone like diamonds.</p>

<p>Carlos Lawson looked at her with unusual
interest. His first thought was of her beauty
but he controlled himself enough to answer:</p>

<p>“The thing would be outrageous!” he said
after a second; “what has that freckle-faced
clod to offer Dollie, I should like to know!”</p>

<p>“He has a farm of his own, that is all,”
said Marion, hotly; “or he may have a mortgage
on father’s, for all I know, but if he had
the wealth of the world he should not have
my little sister!”</p>

<p>“But how can you prevent it?” asked Mr.
Lawson, a little coldly.</p>

<p>Marion looked up at his face and trembled
as she read his glance.</p>

<p>“I—I hoped you would be able to advise
me,” she said, slowly. “I know so little
of the world, Mr. Lawson. Oh, can’t you
think of some way to save my poor sister?”</p>

<p>Once more Marion’s eyes shone through
her tears as she gazed up into his face. Her
full lips trembled with emotion. Her face
was transfused with unusual beauty.</p>

<p>Again the sense of her beauty flitted
through Carlos Lawson’s brain, and this
time he made no attempt to control it. How
had he ever become enamored of pretty
Dollie’s childish face when this spirited creature
was constantly before him!</p>

<p>A dark flush mounted to his cheek and
brow as he bent forward quickly and laid
his hand upon Marion’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I will save her, yes—on one condition,”
he whispered, sharply. “I will save your sister
if you will kiss me, Marion! My God,
but you are beautiful. Quick, Marion—your
answer!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>With a stifled scream Marion Marlowe
flung his hand from her shoulder and sprang
away from him. Her face paled in an instant
at the insult he had offered her.</p>

<p>“So that is the kind of a gentleman you
are,” she said, scornfully. “To try to take
advantage of a girl in her misery!”</p>

<p>The man took a step forward, but Marion
stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to come nearer!” she said
sternly. “I’m only a poor farmer’s daughter,
but I respect myself, sir! I regret that
I spoke to you about Dollie at all! I might
have known better. I have never trusted
you!”</p>

<p>She stood with her right arm upraised as
she said these words, her fair face turned
unflinchingly toward the handsome insulter.</p>

<p>A careless sneer crossed the man’s dark
face.</p>

<p>“You have never trusted me, eh,” he said,
half smilingly. “Well, that will not make
much difference with me, I guess. You’ll
trust me more some day, my haughty Marion!”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Marion, with a hot flush
of shame. “Not as long as I remember
your insulting words. But enough, Mr.
Lawson, I will not detain you longer.”</p>

<p>She swept by him like a queen and went
into the house.</p>

<p>Her mother was sitting in the kitchen patiently
darning stockings.</p>

<p>“Mother! mother!” cried Marion sharply,
as she threw herself on her knees by her
side. “Is it possible that you are willing for
Dollie to be sacrificed? Are you going to sit
calmly by and see her sold in bondage to
Silas Johnson?”</p>

<p>“What kin I dew?” asked her mother, irritably;
“ef your father sez so, what kin I
dew? ’Tain’t a wife’s place to meddle with
her husband’s runnin’ of his fam’ly.”</p>

<p>“But think of it, mother, what her life will
be when she is tied to a man whom she
does not love! Have you no sympathy for
your daughter? Think what you have suffered!
And there is poor Sister Samantha!
She is a perfect slave to her stupid husband,
when with her looks and talents she might
have done so much better!”</p>

<p>“Your father is the head of his fam’ly,”
said her mother again. “It ain’t my place
to go ag’in him. He knows what’s best fer
yew an’ Dollie!”</p>

<p>Marion groaned aloud and rocked back
and forth on the floor.</p>

<p>Dollie opened the door of the little parlor
where she had been busy dusting and stared
at her sister.</p>

<p>She had a big bandanna tied over her saucy
curls, and with her dainty face flushed with
exercise she looked like some quaint, old-fashioned
picture.</p>

<p>“Silas will make her a good husband, I’m
sure,” said Mrs. Marlowe, meekly.</p>

<p>“O’ course he will, Marthy,” said the old
farmer, who came in just as she spoke. “An’
what’s more, I’m a-gittin’ mighty sick of this
tarnal nonsense! Dollie hez got tew marry
Sile, an’ thet’s all ther’ is abaout it! Why,
there’s dozens of gals as would jump at ther’
chance! ’Pears tew me thet Dollie is determined
ter fly in ther face o’ Providence
in ther foolishest manner. She’d orter be
a-thankin’ her stars fer gittin’ sech a husband!”</p>

<p>Dollie stood, duster in hand, staring at
her father as he spoke. There was a dull
look in her eye, as if she had not fully understood
him.</p>

<p>“Dollie! Dollie! Why don’t you speak?
Why don’t you tell father what you think!
Oh, Dollie, what is the matter?” cried Marion
sharply.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t want to marry Silas,” she
finally whispered. “You tell him, Marion,”
she turned to her sister appealingly, and
gazed from one to another of the little group
with a frightened face. She seemed like one
in a trance who was trying to grasp the situation.</p>

<p>Marion sprang forward swiftly and threw
her arms around her sister. There was
something wrong with Dollie, but she had
not time to puzzle out what it was—this question
of her marrying Silas must be settled
at once and forever.</p>

<p>Turning so that she faced both her father
and mother, Marion rested her right hand
lightly on her sister’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I will answer him, sister, and it shall be
once for all, for this anxiety is killing me. I
can brave it no longer. When a girl’s own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>father and mother refuse to protect her it is
high time for some one else to interfere.
Dollie does not love Silas Johnson and she
shall never marry him, for in spite of you
both I will find some way to prevent it.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE ABDUCTION OF DOLLIE.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>Joshua Marlowe’s tanned and bearded
face grew pale at his daughter’s words. They
rang in his ears for hours after she uttered
them. He was not an altogether bad man
at heart, but he was narrow-minded and
ignorant. First of all, he loved his farm;
wife and children came after.</p>

<p>This deal with Silas had been his own secret.</p>

<p>If the marriage was not consummated it
would become public property.</p>

<p>But what was a man to do with a daughter
like Marion? It was a proposition
which would have puzzled a wiser man than
Solomon.</p>

<p>Martha Marlowe had always been an obedient
wife. It did not occur to the old farmer
that Marion might have inherited her
obstinacy in some degree from her father.</p>

<p>The day following the tragic scene in the
kitchen Marion spent in close companionship
with Dollie, but still the girl’s manner baffled
and pained her.</p>

<p>“Are you sick, Dollie, or worried?” she
asked, over and over, but each time there
came the same reply. Her sister declared
that she was perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Marion watched her as she went about her
daily work. She moved like one in a dream,
always smiling, but appealing.</p>

<p>“Poor Dollie! Poor little sister!” Marion
whispered, as she tucked her into bed and
went out into the air to think a little.</p>

<p>It was a clear moonlight night, and Marion
walked farther than she thought, finding herself
again on the brow of the hill where she
had registered her vow during the glow of
sunset.</p>

<p>The distant roar of the express came
slowly to her ears, gradually growing louder
and louder until with a piercing shriek it
prepared to slow down at the little station.</p>

<p>Marion strained her eyes, but not even the
light was visible. For some reason or other
the blast of the whistle had made her shudder.
As the train puffed away she felt curiously
depressed. The air seemed more sultry; it
was almost choking her.</p>

<p>After the last rumble of the wheels had
died away the silence was more intense than
ever.</p>

<p>The very landscape itself seemed wrapped
in slumber, but the view from the hill was
growing more attractive to her eyes, for even
the Poor Farm’s ugliness was mellowed by
the moonlight.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marion’s sharp eyes detected a
moving form. Some one was coming across
the fields from the direction of the Pool
Farm, but avoiding the open spots on the
way in a suspicious manner.</p>

<p>“One of the boys has run away!” exclaimed
Marion, in dismay. “Poor fellow!
He’ll be caught and soundly whipped to-morrow!”</p>

<p>She watched with eager eyes as the poor
boy hurried from lot to lot, keeping as close
as possible in the shadow of the trees, but
as the moments passed there was no sound
from the Poor Farm.</p>

<p>“It’s Bert Jackson!” whispered Marion
as the boy came nearer. “Poor Bert! His
broken arm is well again, they say! I wonder
if he has been flogged that he is running
away from his prison!”</p>

<p>She ran down the hill as swiftly as she
could.</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” she called softly. “It is
only I, Marion! What’s the matter, Bert?
Has anything serious happened?”</p>

<p>The boy came out of the shadow cautiously
and joined her before he answered.</p>

<p>“A great deal has happened,” he said, bitterly;
“but I can’t talk about it. I’m just
boiling with rage! I’m running away, Marion.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Marion, simply, “I knew
that when I saw you, but where can you go,
Bert? ’Tisn’t safe to risk the station, and
besides, there’s no train now ’til to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered Bert quickly. “I’m
going to walk to Haysville. It’s only five
miles, and there’s a train from there to New
York at four in the morning.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>“New York,” echoed Marion, in a frightened
whisper. “That’s a big city, Bert! Are
you sure you ought to go there?”</p>

<p>“The bigger the better,” said the boy, smiling
bitterly. “I’ve got to lose myself for
awhile, you know, so that brute cannot find
me.”</p>

<p>He nodded toward the Poor Farm and
Marion understood the gesture.</p>

<p>“I hate him!” she said, with a stamp of
her foot. “I’ve hated him ever since he hit
you that day, the monster!”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s hit me a good many times
since,” said Bert, slowly. There was a hard
ring in his voice that cut the air like a bit
of metal.</p>

<p>“Have you any money, Bert?” asked Marion,
after a minute.</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” said the boy, doggedly; “but
I reckon I can earn some. I’ll have to steal
my ride to the city, that’s the part that’s bothering
me.”</p>

<p>“No you won’t!” said Marion, stoutly.
“I’ve got five dollars, Bert! Quick, come
back to the house with me! You’ve got to
do it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t take your money,” began
Bert, but Marion stopped him.</p>

<p>“You shall take it. Come!” she said,
commandingly, as she caught his arm and
almost dragged him toward the farm-house.</p>

<p>Leaving Bert hidden behind a clump of
lilacs in the yard, Marion crept stealthily
around to a side door and into the house to
get her five dollars.</p>

<p>A lamp was burning in the sitting-room,
and as Marion passed she glanced up at the
clock. She had been out over two hours,
while every one else was in bed and sleeping.</p>

<p>Marion found the money in her own chamber,
and then tip-toed to Dollie’s. Her anxiety
for her sister was making her almost
nervous.</p>

<p>She peered into the room, which was clearly
lighted by the moon.</p>

<p>Her sister was not there. The bed was
rumpled but empty.</p>

<p>Marion flew down the stairs and through
the side door to the yard.</p>

<p>“Bert! Bert!” she called softly, but nobody
answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, what has happened?” she
whispered to herself. “There’s something
wrong; it’s in the air! I know it! I feel it!”</p>

<p>A soft step on the walk made her turn
expectantly.</p>

<p>Bert Jackson was just behind her. He
had been in the kitchen. He explained it by
whispering that he had been after a drink of
water.</p>

<p>Marion did not give a thought to this fact
while her mind was in such a whirl; she only
hurried to him quickly and gave him the
money.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bert,” she said, in agony. “I can’t
find Dollie! She’s gone somewhere, I don’t
know where! She was in bed when I left
her!”</p>

<p>Bert looked at her in surprise, but there
was no time to lose. He must be off at once
if he expected to catch the train from Haysville.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you hear from me, Marion, in some
way,” he whispered gratefully. “And if anything
has happened to Dollie, you can count
on me. I’ll never forget you, Marion, you
are such a friend to a fellow!”</p>

<p>“Take care of yourself in New York, Bert,”
said the girl, tremblingly, “and who knows
what may happen in that lovely big city?”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Marion,” answered Bert, “I’m
sure something good must happen.”</p>

<p>He darted away and Marion went back
to the house. There was not a sign of her
sister’s returning.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marion made a discovery that
nearly turned her brain. Every article belonging
to Dollie’s Sunday wardrobe was
missing.</p>

<p>In other words, she had dressed herself in
her best when she went, and this fact was
significant even to a girl like Marion.</p>

<p>Darting downstairs, the frightened girl
awoke her father and mother.</p>

<p>“Dollie has gone! She has run away!”
she cried in agony. “Oh, father, come quick
and perhaps we can find her!”</p>

<p>But not a trace of Dollie could be found,
nor was Mr. Lawson, their boarder, to be
found on the premises.</p>

<p>Marion set her teeth hard when she made
this discovery.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone together! He’s took her!”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>whined Mrs. Marlowe. “He’s run off with
my darter! the scallywag!” bawled Deacon
Marlowe, but Marion only clenched her
hands and bit her lips. It was horrible to
think of Dollie in the clutches of her insulter.</p>

<p>“What shall you dew, father?” asked Mrs.
Marlowe, at last.</p>

<p>“Dunno,” said her husband, a little absently.
“I calkerlate, tho’, I’ll jest ler ’er go!
’Pears tew me that’s about what she desarves,
the for’ard critter!”</p>

<p>Marion Marlowe’s eyes flashed as she
heard this decision, but she did not deign
to make any answer.</p>

<p>Going straight to the old chest behind the
kitchen door, she opened the lid and began
overhauling its contents.</p>

<p>“What dew you want in there?” asked her
father, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I want grandma’s topazes,” she said very
firmly. “I am going to sell them to Widow
Pearson; you know she always wanted them,
and the money will enable me to hunt for
Dollie!”</p>

<p>“Yew sha’n’t tech them!” cried both her
mother and father at once.</p>

<p>“They are ours—Dollie’s and mine,” said
Marion, calmly. “I shall use them as I
think best——”</p>

<p>A scream finished the sentence.</p>

<p>“They are gone! The topazes are gone!”
she cried, excitedly. “See, here is the chamois
bag! It is completely empty!”</p>

<p>She held it up to the flickering light that
fell from the tallow candle in her mother’s
hand.</p>

<p>A double crime had been committed—abduction
and theft. Marion sat down on the
chest and burst out crying.</p>

<p>“It’s Dollie that’s done it!” bellowed Deacon
Marlowe angrily. “It wasn’t enough fer
her tew disgrace herself an’ us by runnin’
away with that air feller, but she must up
an’ steal the topazes, the brazen hussy! She
shall never darken my door ag’in! The
wicked jade! the—the——”</p>

<p>“Hush, father! Don’t you dare to call
Dollie names,” cried Marion. “If any one
is to blame, it is that black-hearted scoundrel!
Oh, I knew he was a villain! Why
didn’t I watch him!”</p>

<p>Marion had sprung from the chest and
was confronting the old farmer—her eyes
scintillating with feeling, and her drawn lips
were almost bloodless.</p>

<p>“My sister is innocent! Do you hear me,
father! Shame on you for being the first
to condemn your own daughter!”</p>

<p>Her voice was so sharp that it seemed
to hiss through the air, and the old farmer
shrank back as though she had struck him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marlowe covered her face with her
hands and began to sob, but Marion’s eyes
were burning—she had done with weeping.</p>

<p>Now was the time to act—to save her
sister.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>A DARK DEED.</small></h3>

<p>It was almost dark when a long, dust-covered
train drew slowly under cover of
the Grand Central Depot.</p>

<p>The rush and roar of the big city was
at its height and the pushing, jostling crowd
of travelers inside the station was noisy, rude
and bristling with impatience.</p>

<p>As the long stream of passengers swept
through the yawning archway, a young girl
stepped aside from the throng and leaned in
some bewilderment against the wall of the
building.</p>

<p>No one noticed her at first except by a
casual glance, for she was poorly dressed and
just a bit awkward.</p>

<p>It was plainly evident that she was waiting
for some one.</p>

<p>After several minutes had passed she suddenly
removed her veil—a hideous green one
which had distorted and disguised her features.</p>

<p>After that when any one glanced at her
they turned to look again, for such a face
as Marion Marlowe’s was not often seen in
the big city.</p>

<p>At last the crowd dwindled to only the
employees of the station, and a messenger in
a red cap stepped up and accosted her civilly:</p>

<p>“Excuse me, miss, but can I be of service
to you?” he asked, politely. “You know it’s
our business to look after passengers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Marion, sweetly. “I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>am waiting for my uncle. I wrote him that
I was coming, and I fully expected him to
meet me.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be here if he’s coming,” said
the man, good-naturedly; “you’ve been waiting
nearly an hour. You must be getting
pretty weary.”</p>

<p>“I am, and hungry, too,” said Marion,
smiling; “but you see I am a country girl,
and I don’t know my way. I would certainly
get lost if I were to attempt to find
him.”</p>

<p>As she spoke she did not notice that a
well-dressed man had suddenly drawn near
and was listening intently to her remarks
without appearing to do so.</p>

<p>“What’s his address?” asked the messenger,
in a business-like way.</p>

<p>Marion took a slip of paper from her reticule,
and handed it to him.</p>

<p>“Frederic Stanton, The Norwood,” the
man read aloud. “That’s a good ways from
here. You’d better take a cab.”</p>

<p>“How much will it cost?” asked Marion,
anxiously.</p>

<p>The messenger consulted his table of rates
for a moment before answering.</p>

<p>“Two dollars,” he said, finally; “but of
course your uncle will pay it. Mighty queer
of him not to meet you when he knew you
were a stranger in the city.”</p>

<p>“But you see he doesn’t know me!” said
Marion, quickly. “He married my mother’s
sister Susan, but we girls have never seen
him. I—I was obliged to come here on
business, so I had to write to him. There
was no one else, and he wrote back that
he would meet me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did and didn’t know you,”
said the messenger more cheerfully; “but
anyway. I’ll get you a carriage and send
you to him.</p>

<p>“Here!” he called to a cabman standing
a short distance away. “Take this lady’s
trunk check and here’s the address she’s to
go to.” He turned away with the air of
one who had done his duty.</p>

<p>The man who had been watching Marion
moved a little nearer. When the cabman
came up he heard the conversation between
them.</p>

<p>After the “cabby” had placed Marion in
his vehicle, he started back into the depot
to find her trunk, and as she leaned from
the cab window and looked after him Marion
saw that he was joined by the stranger.</p>

<p>She could not hear what they said, but
she saw the cabman shake his head repeatedly
while the man wrote something on a
piece of paper without once stopping talking.</p>

<p>Finally she saw a bill change hands between
them. The cabman had evidently
relented, for he pocketed not only the money
but the paper the stranger had written.</p>

<p>As the young girl was rapidly driven uptown
she gazed out of the cab windows and
the scenes of the great city made her face
pale and flush alternately.</p>

<p>Every little while she felt in her bag for
her money—the fifty dollars which her father
had at last given her when she denounced
him so vigorously for his treatment
of Dollie.</p>

<p>“I’ll find her! I’ll find her!” she kept
whispering to herself, and then the fearful
proportions of the great city staggered her
and she would be almost overwhelmed by the
enormity of her undertaking.</p>

<p>She took a crumpled paper from her bag
and read it over. It was a letter from Bert
Jackson written in a cleverly disguised hand,
telling her that he had reached New York
safely, and giving her the address of a cheap
lodging-house that he was making his home
for the present.</p>

<p>Marion had answered the letter promptly,
giving him the news of Dollie’s disappearance,
and she knew full well that Bert would
be constantly on the lookout for her sister.</p>

<p>“Poor Bert! I must hunt him up,” she
whispered, with a sigh. “He’ll help me find
Dollie. He’s really my only friend in all
this big city!”</p>

<p>Then another thought entered her mind
and would not go away. She was thinking
of Bert’s visit to the kitchen that last night
and the sudden disappearance of the family
jewels.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have written if he had been
guilty,” she whispered decidedly. “It was
Mr. Lawson who stole them! The infamous
villain who abducted my sister!”</p>

<p>Marion breathed a sigh of thankfulness
that she had never mentioned her suspicions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>There would have been people enough ready
to accuse him if they had known of his visit
to the farmer’s kitchen.</p>

<p>“When one is down, everybody gives
him a kick,” she said to herself. “Even
poor, dear Dollie was not spared! Oh, how
our own neighbors slandered my innocent
sister!”</p>

<p>Just as she finished her reflections the cab
drew up before a handsome building. Marion
saw the words “The Norwood” in gilt
letters over the door, and in another instant
the cabman was at the window.</p>

<p>“You sit here a minute, miss, till I see if
he’s in,” he said, as he moved toward the
entrance. He disappeared within the building,
leaving Marion trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s no wonder Aunt Susan’s husband
never recognized us,” she whispered bitterly.
“He’s rich and lives in luxury, while we are
only poor farmers. Oh, I do hope they
won’t be ashamed of me just because of my
plain clothes.”</p>

<p>She looked down at her homespun dress
with a sorrowful sigh. Then her face brightened
a little as she reflected that at least it
was tidy and very neat fitting. She was not
to blame for her personal appearance.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes elapsed before the
cabman reappeared, but when he finally came
he had a colored man with him, who promptly
lifted Marion’s little trunk to his shoulder.</p>

<p>“This way, miss,” said the negro, and Marion
followed happily. Such proof of her
uncle’s wealth made her heart beat more rapidly.
It did not seem possible that he could
refuse the slight request she had come to
make of him.</p>

<p>Marion’s eyes grew even brighter as she
stepped into the upholstered elevator and
was carried to the top floor.</p>

<p>It was the luxury she had dreamed of
during her whole life on the farm. She
looked upon it as a friend. It neither embarrassed
nor startled her.</p>

<p>At the door of a beautifully decorated
apartment stood a middle-aged man. Marion
had only time to notice that he was bald
and dissipated looking when he stepped forward
smilingly and introduced himself as her
uncle.</p>

<p>“Your aunt is away at present,” he said
glibly, “but our housekeeper, Miss Gray, will
attend to you, my dear. I am sorry, very
sorry, that I missed you at the station.”</p>

<p>“Then you were there!” exclaimed Marion
gladly. “Oh! I was sure you would come—but
I ought to have taken off my veil before.
I had sent you my picture so you would be
sure to know me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are here now, safe and sound,”
said the man rather awkwardly; “but, I say,
niece, isn’t it right that you should kiss your
uncle?”</p>

<p>Marion glanced at him sharply and
colored with surprise. There was something
in his tone that offended her deeply. Should
she refuse? The question flashed through
her brain like lightning. She must win his
good will in order to help Dollie. With this
determination she stepped forward and kissed
him on the cheek.</p>

<p>“Oh! not so cold a kiss, my beauty,” said
the man with a leer; “a real love kiss for your
uncle—like this!” he cried, bending over her.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” cried Marion sharply, springing
back as she spoke. “Don’t look at me that
way; it is not nice at all, and it makes me
feel that you are not really my uncle!”</p>

<p>She stood staring at him with dilated eyes,
and a thrill of horror coursed through her
veins that she could not account for.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of heavy draperies and
a handsomely dressed woman entered.</p>

<p>“Come with me, my dear,” she said shortly.
“Your uncle is not exactly himself to-night.
You see, he has just dined and has
drank a little too heavily.”</p>

<p>Marion drew a long breath as she went immediately
toward the woman. She was glad
that his action could be accounted for reasonably,
but the horror was still there—she
could not overcome it.</p>

<p>The man did not make the slightest attempt
to detain her, but Marion caught a
significant glance which passed between the
two, and her heart began beating so fiercely
that it almost suffocated her.</p>

<p>As soon as she was alone with the woman
whom her uncle had called his housekeeper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>she lost no time in telling the whole story of
the cause of her journey.</p>

<p>“My poor sister has been abducted by a
villain,” she cried in conclusion, “and there
is no one but me to rescue her from him!
Oh, if I should be too late, I am sure it would
kill me!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE PLOT OF A VILLAIN.</small></h3>

<p>Adele Gray listened intently to the country
girl’s story, but not so much as by an expression
did she show that she sympathized.
She was a woman of twenty-five and would
have been exceedingly pretty only that her
face was marred by lines of sorrow about her
mouth and a coldness in her eyes that was
very repelling.</p>

<p>Her gown was of rich materials, and she
wore a few expensive jewels; further, every
movement which she made was indicative of
natural refinement.</p>

<p>The coldness of her manner was something
which she had acquired—even to an inexperienced
girl like Marion it bespoke a morbid
condition.</p>

<p>“I have ordered some dinner for you,” she
said, quietly, as Marion finished. “Here it is;
you must be hungry after your tiresome
journey.” She rose to meet the waiter, who
was placing a loaded tray upon the table.</p>

<p>Marion ate her dinner in some perplexity,
for every few moments Miss Gray excused
herself, and pouring a glass of liquor from a
decanter on the table, took it in to her host,
who still remained in the parlor.</p>

<p>“Does he always drink like that?” Marion
ventured to ask timidly; “for if he does, I am
sorry for my poor aunt. She must be
wretched indeed to have a drunken husband.”</p>

<p>A grim smile stole over the woman’s face.</p>

<p>“He is drinking a little more than usual to-night,”
she said softly, “but don’t worry—it
won’t hurt him, and you will be that much
safer.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?” asked Marion
in alarm.</p>

<p>Miss Gray laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Wait until he is dead drunk,” she said,
“and perhaps I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>Marion was almost too astonished to even
think, but as yet not a suspicion of the truth
had dawned upon her.</p>

<p>That the man in the parlor was her uncle
she did not doubt for an instant, but she was
filled with disgust at the possession of such
a relative.</p>

<p>“Of course he is no blood relation,” she
whispered to herself. “And he may not be a
bad man when he is in his sober senses.
What a pity it is that he should drink!” She
drew a long sigh at the conclusion of her
reverie.</p>

<p>“There!” said Miss Gray, coming in and
depositing an empty glass on the table. “At
last he is safe for the night, at least! Now,
I am ready, Miss Marlowe, to hear the rest of
your story!”</p>

<p>It was the first sign of genuine interest that
she had shown, and Marion smiled at her
gratefully before continuing.</p>

<p>Miss Gray watched her with the sharp
glance of an eagle as she talked. There was
an intensity in her gaze that puzzled Marion.</p>

<p>“And you have come to New York alone
to search for your sister,” she said finally.
“Without funds or friends you have entered
upon this mission?”</p>

<p>“I have fifty dollars,” said Marion reluctantly,
“and, oh, Miss Gray, do you not
think uncle will help me? He must be rich
to live in such luxury!”</p>

<p>Before she answered the question the woman
rose and looked around, moving every
drapery and curtain and looking behind it
cautiously. At the last she tiptoed to the
front room and listened a minute, when she
returned she moved her chair as closely as
possible to Marion’s.</p>

<p>“See here, girl, you look brave,” she said,
very softly. “Can you face a serious matter
without flinching, do you think? I have something
to tell you, but you must promise to
be perfectly calm when you hear it.”</p>

<p>As she spoke Marion noticed that her
hands were trembling; she clinched them
tightly, as though she resented this trace of
weakness.</p>

<p>“I promise,” said Marion, staring wide-eyed
at the woman. “I am not a child, Miss
Gray—you must see that you can trust me.”</p>

<p>“I see that I can,” was the quiet answer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>then the woman leaned forward and whispered
rapidly:</p>

<p>“You have made a terrible mistake, my
child, but you are not to blame. You are in
the wrong place—your host is not your
uncle!”</p>

<p>Marion caught her breath sharply but did
not utter a sound.</p>

<p>“Who is he, then?” she said softly, clasping
her hands tightly together.</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders and
glanced quickly around the room.</p>

<p>“Never mind who he is,” she said, almost
roughly. “He is not your uncle, and he is
not married. Now tell me, who is your
uncle, and how did you come here?”</p>

<p>Marion replied with eager promptness:</p>

<p>“My uncle is Frederic Stanton, and he lives
at ‘The Norwood.’ I wrote him at that address
and he answered my letter. He married
my mother’s sister, and he is very rich,
so rich that he has never recognized any of
his wife’s relatives in the country. When
Dollie was abducted my father disowned
her and I was obliged to write to uncle, then
I came to him,” she finished simply.</p>

<p>“There are a dozen apartment houses in
the city by that name,” said the woman
thoughtfully. “He probably lives at the
biggest one, uptown on Fifth avenue.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Marion anxiously.
“I only knew ‘The Norwood.’ You see I
did not even think that there might be two
of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, he should have thought and told
you,” said the woman, “or the cabman
should have as soon as you told him.”</p>

<p>Marion gave a quick exclamation, which
was as quickly smothered. She had thought
of something that might explain it.</p>

<p>“There was a man watching me in the
station while I was waiting,” she said slowly.
“He heard uncle’s name and the address,
I am sure, and afterward I saw him give the
cabman some money and a scrap of paper.
Do you suppose it is possible——”</p>

<p>Miss Gray interrupted her:</p>

<p>“Is that the piece of paper?” she asked,
drawing a scrap from her pocket.</p>

<p>Marion took it and read these astonishing
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Ted: Here’s a treasure, right fresh
from the country. Name, Marion Marlowe,
looking for her uncle, Frederic Stanton at
‘The Norwood.’ Married her mother’s sister,
but she has never seen him. Expected
him to meet her, but, luckily for you, he
didn’t. I’ll be around to-night; meanwhile I
wish you luck. Don’t ever say again that
I’m not a judge of beauty.”</p></div>

<p>The note was not signed, and Marion
looked at the woman inquiringly.</p>

<p>“That was written by the blackest villain
in New York,” said Miss Gray, her voice
vibrating strangely, “and it is not his first
effort in that direction either.”</p>

<p>Marion rose from her chair and confronted
the woman. She understood at last
the full horror of her position.</p>

<p>“I am the victim of a plot,” she said at
last. “Oh, my dear Miss Gray, how can I
thank you for telling me?”</p>

<p>For once the woman smiled; her features
had softened amazingly. Marion’s expressions
of gratitude seemed thawing her coldness.</p>

<p>“But can I not protect myself against
them?” asked Marion, after a minute. “Can’t
I have them arrested by a policeman or
something?”</p>

<p>Miss Gray smiled at the country girl’s ignorance
of such matters.</p>

<p>“No use,” she said shortly. “What could
you do? You haven’t an atom of proof that
you did not come here freely.”</p>

<p>“But that bit of paper?” cried Marion,
pointing to the note that Miss Gray was holding
between her fingers.</p>

<p>In the coolest possible manner the woman
tore it into atoms.</p>

<p>“Would mean nothing at all, I can assure
you,” she said quickly; “for in the first place,
I have destroyed it.”</p>

<p>She rose and tossed the fragments into the
grate as she spoke. Marion stared at her
helplessly; she was too bewildered to answer.</p>

<p>When Miss Gray came back her eyes were
shining dangerously.</p>

<p>“They have gone a little too far in their
dastardly deeds this time,” she said in a
whisper. “But have I the courage to thwart
their plottings?”</p>

<p>She began pacing the floor as she asked
the question.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>Marion watched her for a moment in
sympathetic silence. The woman’s agony
was so genuine that it could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall despise myself utterly if I do
not save her!” she muttered, “for the others
it did not matter, but this poor child is innocent!”</p>

<p>Marion sprang to her side as she comprehended
her meaning.</p>

<p>“You surely do not mean that he would
harm me!” she whispered sharply. “Never!
Never! Miss Gray, the thing is outrageous!
Come! Let us leave this place at once,” she
urged. “Surely you can get a position elsewhere!
You need not work for such a monster!”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated a moment and Marion
doubled her entreaties.</p>

<p>“Come, Miss Gray, put your hat on and
we will leave this place at once! We will
go somewhere, anywhere, so that we escape
from that creature!”</p>

<p>“If he finds me I am lost!” muttered the
woman slowly, then she raised her head defiantly,
as she added, “but I will risk it!”</p>

<p>“But surely he is not your jailer,” cried
Marion in surprise.</p>

<p>“He is worse than that,” was the woman’s
answer. “He has wrecked my life, and made
me his tool, but it shall end to-night, yes,
by your purity, I swear it!”</p>

<p>There was a sudden fierceness in her
speech that startled Marion. She resembled
nothing so much as a creature at bay, a poor,
wounded creature who had turned upon her
persecutors and was thirsting for vengeance.</p>

<p>A church clock struck ten as they left the
building, the country girl, as innocent as an
angel, and the woman who admitted that her
life was clouded and blackened.</p>

<p>“Where shall we go?” asked Marion as
they reached the curb. The lights of the big
city were already bewildering her.</p>

<p>A cab rattled up to the entrance as she
spoke and a man sprang out and started into
the building.</p>

<p>Miss Gray caught Marion by the arm and
pulled her into the shadow.</p>

<p>“That is Emile Vorse—your pseudo
uncle’s boon companion,” she whispered
savagely.</p>

<p>“It is the man who watched me at the
depot,” answered Marion, as she gave him
a sharp glance. “Oh, I never knew before
that such creatures existed!”</p>

<p>“Come,” said her companion, as she hurried
down the street. “I must get as far
away as possible now that Emile has come.
He will arouse his friend, and that means
that my hours are numbered.”</p>

<p>“What injury could they do you?” whispered
Marion as they hurried along.</p>

<p>“They could tell the truth about me and
make me lose my soul!” was the woman’s
strange answer. “One more goad from that
villain and I shall commit murder!”</p>

<p>Marion shuddered violently, but there was
nothing to be said. Her companion had
hailed a cab and was helping her into it.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>ON THE TRACK OF THE ABDUCTOR.</small></h3>

<p>A half hour later Miss Gray and Marion
alighted before a small, third rate hotel and
Miss Gray paid the cabman with a bill which
seemed to be all the money she had in her
purse.</p>

<p>Almost as if in a dream Marion followed
her into the office and up the stairs to a
room on the top floor.</p>

<p>“We’ll stay here to-night,” said Miss Gray,
as she locked the door carefully, “and to-morrow
you shall go to your real uncle, Miss
Marlowe. Just remember that ‘The Norwood’
is on Fifth avenue; any officer will
direct you if I should not be able to go with
you.”</p>

<p>“But, dear Miss Gray—you are in trouble
yourself, I am sure of it,” said Marion
eagerly. “Can’t I help you in any way?
Just think how much I owe you!”</p>

<p>“You can help me, yes, but I will not
tell you how, now,” was the woman’s answer;
“neither will I tell you my story. It is
not fit for your ears. Some other time, when
I have vindicated myself perhaps—but come—let
us retire, for you are weary and sleepy.”</p>

<p>Marion went to bed gratefully, for she
was almost worn out with excitement and
fatigue. In spite of her anxiety and bewilderment
she soon fell asleep and slept
soundly.</p>

<p>When she awoke next morning the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>was shining brightly. She raised herself
from the pillow only to find that Miss Gray
had deserted her.</p>

<p>“Gone! And I am all alone!”</p>

<p>Marion whispered the words as she sprang
out of bed. After a hasty glance about the
room she was more astonished than ever.</p>

<p>Not only had her companion left her alone
in the hotel, but she had taken every article
of Marion’s homely wardrobe, leaving her
own expensive garments in exchange for the
poor ones.</p>

<p>Marion sat down in amazement to think
over the situation. Suddenly she remembered
her money and sprang up to look for
her reticule.</p>

<p>She was horror struck when she found that
gone also. In its place was Miss Gray’s
expensive pocket-book. She opened it
quickly. It contained the contents of her
bag minus forty dollars. Marion looked
at the lone five-dollar bill in despair.</p>

<p>“Well, if this doesn’t beat all!” she said
aloud. Then in spite of her dismay she
burst out laughing, and the result was wonderful—her
courage came back to her.</p>

<p>“I guess I have the best of the bargain
after all,” she went on as she looked at the
clothing, “but it will never do for me to go to
see uncle in that dress! He would be suspicious
of me right away! As like as not he
would think I had stolen it.”</p>

<p>She mused a little longer and then began
to dress. It was evident that she must wear
Miss Gray’s gown for awhile, at least, and
at last she became curious to see how she
would look in it.</p>

<p>“It fits as if it was made for me,” she
whispered as she tripped over to the mirror.
“We must be nearly the same size, for even
her shoes are just my number.”</p>

<p>She glanced down at her little foot with
a feeling of pride—it was the first time she
had ever worn any shoes but “cowhides.”</p>

<p>When the dainty, graceful girl was fully
arrayed in the stylish garments she could
not help flushing with pride at her pretty
reflection. A beautifully made suit of rich,
blue crepon, a dainty hat, gloves, veil and
tan shoes made up a far prettier costume
than she had ever hoped to wear, and surely
she was justified in taking the good of it, for
it was no fault of hers that Miss Gray preferred
homespun.</p>

<p>As soon as Marion was dressed she went
directly to the office, hoping to learn something
of her companion from the clerk
behind the desk, but on her guard not to
say anything that might sound as if she
mistrusted her.</p>

<p>The man behind the desk gave her a
glance of admiration, but it was plain that
he saw nothing unusual in her appearance.</p>

<p>“She went out about daylight,” he said,
in answer to her question. “She paid for the
room. Do you wish to keep it any longer?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know yet,” answered Marion,
trying not to appear green, “I’ll just have
some breakfast, I think, and then I have an
errand to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it will be here when you want
it,” said the clerk good-naturedly, “and, anyway,
it is yours until eleven o’clock to-night,
so you’ve got all day to make up your mind.
The dining-room is right in here, if you are
looking for breakfast.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him sweetly, and walked
to a table with as much grace as a queen,
although the long skirts were clumsy and
made her feel a little awkward.</p>

<p>There were a dozen or more people just
taking breakfast, and they all stared at her
in such open admiration that the young girl
could feel herself blushing hotly.</p>

<p>When she paid her bill she was glad to find
a young woman at the desk. She looked
pale and worn, but her face was not unkindly.</p>

<p>“Do you know where I could find a real
cheap boarding-house, miss?” she asked
timidly.</p>

<p>The young woman looked her over critically
before she answered.</p>

<p>“Sure! I know dozens of ’em,” was her
rather curt reply. “But, Gee! you don’t
want a very cheap one, I guess! You don’t
look as if you had to count your pennies!”</p>

<p>“But I do,” said Marion, smiling, as she
comprehended the look: “and I’d be very
much obliged if you could give me some addresses.”</p>

<p>The cashier scribbled two or three on a
piece of paper. “Here, I guess these are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>about the thing you want,” she said, handing
it to Marion.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she has run away from home,”
she said to a waiter, as Marion thanked her
and moved away. “She looks like a rich
girl all right, but it’s ten to one she’s had
a scrap with her folks! She’ll get sick of it,
I’m thinking, especially if she goes to boarding.”</p>

<p>When Marion reached the sidewalk she
opened Bert’s letter and read it again. It
was a Bowery lodging-house that he was
stopping at when he wrote, and she decided
to hunt him up and consult with him before
going to her uncle.</p>

<p>“He may be able to advise me,” she
thought, “and I need a friend now if I ever
did, for I am alone in this big city with only
five dollars! Oh, shall I ever be able to find
my poor sister?”</p>

<p>As she walked slowly along the street she
studied the street signs carefully, and more
than once she saw both women and men
half stop to stare at her.</p>

<p>Finally she saw a big man in a blue uniform,
and knowing that he must be a policeman
she went up boldly and asked him to
direct her to the lodging-house.</p>

<p>“Is there some one there you know?”
asked the officer kindly, “’cause if there isn’t
you’d better keep out of that neighborhood.
I can see you’re a stranger, although you
don’t look like a country girl by a jug-full!”</p>

<p>“Well, I am nothing else,” answered
Marion, smiling a little. “But I am not
afraid to go to the lodging-house if you will
tell me the way. I can take care of myself, I
am sure, and there is a boy there that I must
see, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said the officer as she
finished speaking. “Just walk over two
blocks and take a Third avenue car. Tell
the conductor to put you off at the number
you’ve got. I wouldn’t try to walk there—you’re
apt to get tangled.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him and hurried on, her
cheeks tingling with excitement. It was
lovely to be in a big city at last. To be
actually experiencing one of her daisy chain
wishes, but the next moment she thought
of Dollie, and all the pleasure vanished.</p>

<p>There was no car in sight so Marion
walked on. She was thinking deeply of
Dollie now, and was almost crying.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man brushed past her and
leered into her face. Marion turned her
head instantly and stepped up as if to glance
into a nearby window. The man walked
on, leaving Marion staring absently at an
array of jewelry, seemingly odds and ends,
which were displayed in the window with
price marks attached to them.</p>

<p>Slowly, and almost without realizing it
Marion’s gaze concentrated itself upon a
pair of curious shaped earrings. They were
golden brown topazes in quaint, old fashioned
settings. Then with a little scream she
leaned forward until her head nearly touched
the pane. They were her grandmother’s
topazes—she recognized them instantly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE FIRST NEWS OF DOLLIE.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>As soon as Marion had recovered from
her surprise at discovering the familiar
jewels in such an unexpected manner in this
little shop, she determined to make some
inquiries.</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me where you got
those?” she asked of the big nosed Israelite
behind the counter, at the same time pointing
to the topazes in the window.</p>

<p>“I comes honestly by doze, is dat vat you
vant to know?” said the shopkeeper,
shrewdly. He was on his guard instantly,
and had no notion of parting with the jewels.
From the nature of the place and its surroundings
Marion easily guessed that it was
one of those establishments where the
possessor of jewelry is not too closely questioned
as to where it was obtained, so long
as he is willing to sell it at a low price. In
other words a place where stolen goods are
bought and sold.</p>

<p>“I don’t want them,” said Marion quickly,
as she guessed what he meant, “I just want
to get the address of the person that left them
here. She is a friend of mine, the woman
who owned them, and I want to find her if
she is in the city.”</p>

<p>The man looked at her sharply and saw
that he had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>“I tells nottings,” he said, crossly, “except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>dat I bought them vrom a man vot I nefer
saw before.”</p>

<p>“Then it was not a lady who left them,”
said the country girl, quickly.</p>

<p>“I tells nottings more,” repeated the man.</p>

<p>Marion left the shop, being unable to elicit
further information. She was satisfied now
that Mr. Lawson was in the city—or was it
Bert who had pawned them? It lay between
them.</p>

<p>“I am sure it was Lawson,” she whispered
firmly: “I will not allow myself to think ill
of Bert. Poor boy, I pity him, alone in this
big city.”</p>

<p>She hailed a car and was soon riding down
the Bowery just as the officer had told her,
but she was so upset over her discovery
that she hardly glanced out of the window.</p>

<p>Twice the conductor had to ask her for
her fare, and when the stylish, handsome
girl asked him how much the ride would cost
he stared at her in earnest, and so did the
passengers.</p>

<p>But Marion was learning very rapidly,
now. Excitement was clearing her brain
and sharpening her wits. It would not be
very long before she would rid herself of
her timidity at the great city’s bewilderments.</p>

<p>When she reached the lodging-house she
found a pleasant faced man at the desk, who
spoke to her kindly when she stated her
errand.</p>

<p>“There’s been a boy here for two weeks
by the name of Bert Jackson,” he said at
once, “but he went away yesterday because
he had no money. He’ll show up again,
I presume, so you can leave a note for him
if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Poor Bert!” cried Marion impulsively,
“but what will he do without any money?”</p>

<p>“You can trust that kid for getting
along,” said the gentleman laughing. “He’s
the oldest sixteen year old I ever saw. Why
he’s as bright as a New York boy already,
yet he tells me he has always lived in the
country.”</p>

<p>A half dozen ragged boys came in just
then and stood eyeing Marion in great astonishment.
The young girl soon caught
some whispered remarks, which she knew
were intended to express admiration.</p>

<p>“She’s de swellest t’ing wots come down
de pike! Bert Jackson must belong ter de
high-mucker-mucks ter have loidies in togs
like dose a comin’ ter see him!”</p>

<p>“She’s er Jim Dandy fer fair! Oh, why
ain’t I got one coming wid me? Dat’s my
bloomin’ luck!” was the whispered answer.</p>

<p>The gentleman at the desk was just handing
Marion a pencil when a commotion in
the street made them both turn and look
out of the window.</p>

<p>“It’s Bert Jackson! De cops got ’im!”
yelled one of the boys, and in a second the
whole group of them were out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is Bert,” cried Marion, as she
caught sight of her friend, standing up very
straight with a policeman’s hand on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“He’s got into some scrape. I’ll go and
see what it’s about,” said the gentleman, and
as he started for the door Marion followed
him promptly.</p>

<p>The sidewalk was fairly blocked with boys
when they finally got out, and there seemed
to be scores of them coming from all
directions.</p>

<p>“He knocked a gentleman down,” said the
officer, as he recognized the superintendent
of the lodging-house.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t a gentleman, he was an abductor!”
cried Bert Jackson stoutly, and just
at that moment he caught sight of Marion.</p>

<p>For a second the stylish garments puzzled
him a little, then he threw up his hat
and gave a whoop that made even the officer
jump in astonishment.</p>

<p>“She’s here! Dollie is here! I just saw
her!” he shouted. “She was with that fellow
Lawson, and, I tell you, I hit him a
good one!”</p>

<p>“Which way did they go?” cried Marion,
trying to push her way to his side.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see!” said Bert bitterly, “for
the cops had collared me, but I hit him
once, anyway! Some day he’ll get another!”</p>

<p>”What does he mean?” asked the superintendent,
who hated to see Bert taken to the
station-house. “Perhaps if you can explain
it the officer will let him go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let him go, sir,” cried Marion
instantly. “The poor boy is trying to help
me find my sister Dollie, who was abducted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>three weeks ago from our home in the
country!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come off!” said the officer, turning to
scowl at the boy. “Dat’s all very foine, but
it don’t go wid Moike O’Flarrity.”</p>

<p>“It’s truth just the same, and if it hadn’t
been for you I’d have knocked him silly,”
said Bert, scowling back at his captor. “I
was trying to speak to Dollie and he stepped
between us. I intended to knock him down
and then run away with her.”</p>

<p>“Sure, dat’s just wot I t’ought,” said the
officer promptly; “attempting to kidnap a
gurrul in broad daylight and right in me
beat, the impudent shpalpeen!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you can let him go, can’t
you, officer?” asked the superintendent coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Not on yer loife!” was the reply. “Wot
’ud the capting say to me? Faith, an’ it’s to
the station-house I’ll tak’ him, and let the
s’argent dale wid him!”</p>

<p>“And you let that villain escape while
you arrested a boy!” cried Marion, half crying.
“Oh, my poor little sister! Will I ever
find her?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask them at headquarters
to send out a general alarm, miss?” asked
the superintendent as the officer strode on,
half dragging Bert along with him.</p>

<p>Marion’s eyes flew open in unbounded
surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, I never thought of that,” she said
delightedly, “I came here all alone to look
for my sister!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got lots of courage,” remarked
the superintendent, staring at her.</p>

<p>“Poor Bert! I am so sorry for him!”
cried Marion in distress. “To think he
should have been on the very verge of
rescuing Dollie when he got arrested!”</p>

<p>“They’ll help you at headquarters,” said
the superintendent kindly, as he wrote some
directions on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>“Will you keep this address and give it
to Bert when he comes back?” asked Marion,
as she scribbled the name of the hotel where
she had spent the night.</p>

<p>“Certainly, miss, and I’ll do more,” said
the gentleman smiling; “I’ll go around to
the station-house at once and try to get
him out. I think I know a way to outwit
that brutal officer.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him warmly and then
started uptown, but before she could make
her visit to headquarters conscientiously she
felt that she ought to do a little thinking.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, miss, but I think there
is a pickpocket following you!”</p>

<p>A gentlemanly voice spoke almost in Marion’s
ear as she walked along, with her eyes
bent on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The young girl looked up quickly and saw
a gentleman at her side. He had spoken so
quietly that his sudden news did not alarm
her.</p>

<p>Marion turned and saw a slouching figure
skulking swiftly around the corner, and then
she also noticed that she had lost her way,
she was no longer on the Bowery.</p>

<p>“I have nothing that he could steal, but I
thank you just the same,” she said politely, as
she glanced up at the aristocratic looking
stranger who was gazing at her admiringly.</p>

<p>“It is a bad neighborhood for well-dressed
people, particularly ladies,” said the young
man, smiling. “These thugs would knock
you down and steal your pocket-book in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” said Marion, clutching
Miss Gray’s beautiful purse a bit tighter;
“but I am afraid I have lost my way, I
am going to Police Headquarters.”</p>

<p>The young man looked surprised, but he
answered very pleasantly:</p>

<p>“You have, indeed, but I can soon set
you right. I am bound for that neighborhood
myself, and will be glad to escort you
if you will allow me.”</p>

<p>Marion looked up at him shyly before
she answered. As their eyes met she blushed
deeply with a delicious sensation of pleasure.
He was smiling down at her so sweetly and
with such honest admiration that her heart
went out to him instantly—she knew that she
could trust him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE PICTURE ON THE POSTER.</small></h3>

<p>“My dear Miss Marlowe, I would certainly
tell the Chief of Police every word that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>have just told me! Why the thing is infamous!
I can hardly believe it!”</p>

<p>“Yet, it is true, every word, and I am
glad I have told you, Mr. Ray! Some way
you have given me courage by your unexpected
sympathy. Yet it is strange that I
should have made such a confidant of a
stranger.”</p>

<p>“You can trust me absolutely, my dear
young lady! I would scorn to deceive any
man in the world, much less a young girl
who needs my friendship and protection.”</p>

<p>Marion was walking side by side with
the young man whom she had met and
who had insisted upon escorting her all
the way to Police Headquarters. She could
not explain how she came to tell him her
story. It must have been her unaccountable
confidence in the handsome young stranger.
When she glanced at him shyly she read
only honor and chivalry in his face, and
every word that he uttered served to convince
her of his refinement. It was plainly
to be seen that he was a thorough gentleman,
and if fine clothing counted for anything
he was certainly wealthy.</p>

<p>“And you think no harm would come
to Miss Gray by my story?” she asked
eagerly. “Poor girl, I am sure that she
must have been deeply wronged, and not
by one word would I ever injure her!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for her, too,” said the young
man, seriously. “Her case is a sad one, I
am sure. There are many such cases, the
more’s the pity. But you must sacrifice her
in order to save your sister. You will
have to tell the whole story; there is no way
out of it.”</p>

<p>“I will if I must,” said the fair girl,
sighing; “for first of all I must rescue my
poor sister from the clutches of that scoundrel—but
oh, Mr. Ray, do look at that picture!”</p>

<p>Marion had just caught sight of a flaming
“poster” on the side of a building directly in
front of them. She stopped as if spellbound
and gazed at it intently. Her companion
stared at it also, but could not quite understand
her emotion.</p>

<p>“Carlos Dabroski, Professor of Hypnotism,”
glared in large type from the poster
directly over a full-sized lithograph of a man
in evening dress, apparently addressing an
audience.</p>

<p>“What is it, Miss Marlowe?” asked the
young man quickly.</p>

<p>Marion gasped for breath as she tried to
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Ray, that is the picture of Mr.
Lawson!”</p>

<p>“What! the fellow that abducted your
sister?” cried her companion in dismay.</p>

<p>The beautiful lips quivered pitifully over
the awful revelation.</p>

<p>“I am almost sure it is the same,” she
murmured as she stared hard at the picture.
“He is changed in some way, I can’t tell
exactly how. Oh, I see it all now! The
black-hearted monster! He hypnotized her,
my poor, innocent sister!”</p>

<p>“He is to give an exhibition of his power
to-night,” said Mr. Ray, who was reading the
big bill. “The rascal will hypnotize some
‘subjects’ at Poole’s Theatre this evening.”</p>

<p>Marion shut her white teeth with a defiant
snap.</p>

<p>“Well, he shall have me for an audience,
Mr. Ray,” she exclaimed, sharply. “Oh, to
think of my sister being in the clutches of
that monster!”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Miss Marlowe! You may be
mistaken,” said Mr. Ray, quickly.</p>

<p>It hurt him as much to see her grief as
though she had been his own loved sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going to cry,” whispered
Marion, with the tears almost on her lashes,
“but I am going to do some plotting to trap
that fiend; and, oh, Mr. Ray, I do hope that
you will help me!”</p>

<p>She turned toward him appealingly and
held out her hand. There was an expression
on her face that made it radiantly beautiful.
Archie Ray glanced around quickly.
There was nobody looking.</p>

<p>He would have given the whole world to
have clasped her in his arms, but he knew instinctively
that such an action would never
be forgiven him.</p>

<p>As he controlled himself and raised her
hand to his lips, he murmured softly:</p>

<p>“Till death, Miss Marlowe, you can count
upon my friendship, for although I have not
known you an hour yet——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly. An eloquent glance
from his dark eyes left no doubt of his sentiments.</p>

<p>Marion’s hand trembled in his grasp and
her face was suffused with blushes. For a
moment she was so confused that she did
not know how to answer.</p>

<p>“You are very, very kind,” she stammered
at last, “and I appreciate your—your friendship,
I assure you, Mr. Ray. It comes like
a burst of sunshine in this awful hour of misery.
If you will only help me to save my
sister! Every hour, every moment must be
fraught with agony to poor Dollie.”</p>

<p>“Let us hurry to Police Headquarters,”
said the young man, quickly, “and you must
tell them all—every word of your story.”</p>

<p>There was no hesitation in Marion’s manner
now, although she inwardly prayed that
her words would not bring Miss Gray into
any trouble.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>“She was a true friend to me,” she said,
very sadly. “Poor girl! I pity her with my
whole heart and soul. If I could only find a
way to punish that old monster.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’s a bad egg,” said the young
fellow, thoughtfully. “There are lots of his
sort in the city, unfortunately, and no woman
is wholly safe who falls into their clutches.”</p>

<p>“Poor Miss Gray was afraid of him,” said
Marion, sadly, “but she has defied him now.
Oh. I do hope it is well with her.”</p>

<p>“She stole your money,” was the man’s
curt answer.</p>

<p>“She took it,” corrected the young girl,
quickly, “but she left me all her expensive
clothes. There is a mystery in her actions
that I cannot fathom.”</p>

<p>“Well, one at a time,” said her escort, smiling;
“but here we are at headquarters, Miss
Marlowe. Shall I go in with you?”</p>

<p>He looked at her anxiously as he asked the
question.</p>

<p>A soft, rosy flush stole over her face.</p>

<p>“I think not,” she said slowly, as she gave
him an arch smile. “I’ll have quite enough
to do without explaining our acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I guess you are right,” said Mr. Ray, as
he returned the smile. “I will be on that
corner when you come out, Miss Marlowe,
for I don’t intend to leave you until you are
safe with your uncle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried the girl, gratefully.
“You are more than kind.”</p>

<p>Then a deep flush mantled her charming
features as she remembered the words of almost
love which he had spoken.</p>

<p>In another minute she was on the steps of
the building. Her heart was beating so hard
that she could almost hear it, but she was
determined not to falter in her search for
Dollie.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell all!” she whispered, “everything
that has happened except”—here she paused
and blushed a little deeper—“except that I
have met a young man whom I think is just
the most charming gentleman that I have
ever met.”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>MARION FINDS HER UNCLE AT LAST.</small></h3>

<p>A visit to the chief of police was naturally
an embarrassment to a young and inexperienced
girl like Marion, but his kindly manner
put her at her ease.</p>

<p>He was unusually interested in the astonishing
story which this beautiful
country girl told him. If he doubted her
words he did not betray it, so Marion talked
on rapidly, feeling sure of his sympathy. The
only item of information which Marion kept
back was the fact that Bert Jackson had
run away from the Poor Farm, and it did
not occur to the great detective to question
her on that point. Every word that she uttered
was carefully taken down, and before
she left the building an investigation was in
progress.</p>

<p>She told him of Bert’s adventure with
the hypnotist, and the chief sent an order for
his immediate release.</p>

<p>“Now, what are you going to do next,
miss?” the chief asked her kindly. “You
seem to have a mind of your own, and I
would like to hear what you will do personally
toward finding your sister.”</p>

<p>Marion looked at him fearlessly, as she
answered promptly:</p>

<p>“I shall go to that theatre to-night, sir,
accompanied by Bert, and see this Professor
Dabroski. If he is our former boarder, Mr.
Lawson, I shall know him instantly. He
may be disguised, but I am sure I shall know
him!”</p>

<p>The chief looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you will,” he said slowly. “I
should hate to be the man to do you an injury,
Miss Marlowe.”</p>

<p>This shrewd, worldly man had read the
fair face at a glance. He saw in the flash
of those gray eyes an indomitable spirit.</p>

<p>“I might forgive one to myself, but to my
sister, never!” said Marion, sternly.</p>

<p>The chief was gazing at her in admiration.
She looked like a queen with her head poised
so defiantly.</p>

<p>“Here is Frederic Stanton’s address,” he
said, after a minute, as he glanced over a
directory. “Why, he is a prominent society
man, Miss Marlowe. He is as proud as
Lucifer. Are you sure he will help you?”</p>

<p>Poor Marion sighed.</p>

<p>“He must,” she said, slowly, “for I have
not five dollars in the world, and there is no
one else I can look to.”</p>

<p>The head of the great Detective Bureau
did a few minutes’ thinking, then he gave
Marion some instructions, all of which she
promised to follow.</p>

<p>“These are very necessary,” he told her as
he finished, “for if this villain has wronged
your sister he must be punished without
mercy. And now you had best go right up
to ‘The Norwood’ and see your uncle. If he
will help you, all right; if he won’t, why
just let me know. You can stay at that hotel
that you mentioned at present, and one of my
men will be on hand at the theatre this evening.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him for his advice and
accompanied by Bert, joined Mr. Ray on the
corner. Bert and Mr. Ray were introduced,
and immediately seemed to take a mutual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>liking to each other. She had her uncle’s
correct address now, and they were soon at
“The Norwood.” Mr. Ray slipped his card
into her hand as he and Bert left her at the
door.</p>

<p>“We’ll call for you here later,” he said;
with an admiring glance, “and if we don’t
find you we’ll go over to the little hotel. Just
as like as not your uncle will give you the
cold shoulder.”</p>

<p>“He may,” said Marion, sadly, “for I’ve
heard that he is very proud. And he
doesn’t know the whole truth of my visit to
the city.”</p>

<p>With a last glance of sympathy her friends
turned away. Marion was alone again,
but this time she was at the door of her own
aunt’s dwelling.</p>

<p>She was ushered into a reception-room by
a smartly-dressed maid, who glanced her
over critically and evidently approved of her
appearance.</p>

<p>“Wonder how she would have liked me
in my own clothes?” thought Marion. “Ten
to one I’d have received some cold glances
from her if it wasn’t that I look so out and
out stylish.”</p>

<p>After quite a long wait she was ushered
into her Aunt Susan’s presence. It was the
most unpleasant moment of the young girl’s
whole adventure.</p>

<p>A fat, pudgy woman, very showily dressed,
but who looked quite a little like her own
mother, rose from a sofa as she entered.</p>

<p>There was a poodle in her arms that
snapped and barked savagely.</p>

<p>“So this is my niece,” said the woman,
languidly. She raised a lorgnette to her
eyes and stared at Marion rudely.</p>

<p>“I am your Niece Marion, Aunt Susan,”
said Marion as sweetly as possible. “I came
yesterday, as I wrote you, but I must have
missed uncle at the station.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he did not attempt to meet you,” said
her aunt, said languidly. “He found he had
a dinner engagement which prevented, but
really, my dear, you are better than I expected.”</p>

<p>At this cool announcement, Marion’s color
rose, but she bit her lips to control her feelings.</p>

<p>“Thank you, aunt,” she said, simply; “I
am glad that you approve of me. Your sister’s
children are not gawks, even if they do
live in the country.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” said her aunt, “and it relieves
my mind considerably. But tell me, Marion,
how do you happen to be wearing such
expensive clothes? Why, they are really
quite fashionable! Can your father afford
to dress you so stylishly?”</p>

<p>Marion burst out laughing before she answered.</p>

<p>“My father would not know me if he
should see me,” she said honestly. “You
see I have dressed myself according to my
surroundings, aunt. I knew you would feel
disgraced if I came to you in homespun.”</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful indeed!” said her aunt,
thawing out a little. “Take off your hat,
Marion, and I will order some luncheon.
Really, you are extremely pretty. I am very
glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Marion’s lip curled scornfully as she took
off her hat. She would have been glad to
have boxed the old lady’s ears, but as she
couldn’t she watched her chance and teased
the poodle for relief.</p>

<p>In a moment the door opened and her
uncle came in. He was a pompous-looking
man who tried to impress every one with his
importance. He greeted her with a patronizing
nod, looking her over critically, as his
wife had before him.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, of course,” he remarked,
very frigidly, “but we are, er—very busy,
don’t you know—so much doing in our set at
present.”</p>

<p>Marion ate lunch with her relations before
she told her story. She felt that she must
fortify herself against what was probably
coming.</p>

<p>When the servant had cleared away the
things, she began talking quietly. She was
determined to lose no time in enlisting her
uncle’s sympathy.</p>

<p>“What! Dolly abducted, and here in New
York?”</p>

<p>“You were sent to the apartments of a
bachelor—alone!”</p>

<p>“Stayed all night at a cheap hotel with a—a
man’s housekeeper, did you say?”</p>

<p>These exclamations of dismay interrupted
Marion’s narrative.</p>

<p>“There—now I have told you all, uncle!”
cried Marion, as she finished. “I have told
you the whole truth, and I must rely upon
your kindness! I should not have dreamed
of coming to you had not Dollie’s own
father disavowed her.”</p>

<p>“And quite right of him, I say!” almost
screamed her Aunt Susan, who had supplied
herself with smelling salts before Marion’s
story was half over.</p>

<p>“And you expect me, a society leader, to
mix myself up in this affair! Why, the
thing is disgraceful! It will all be in the
papers!”</p>

<p>Her uncle puffed himself up to an alarming
degree as he spoke, but Marion controlled
her feeling of disgust by a powerful
effort.</p>

<p>“Is it anything against poor Dollie that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>she should have been hypnotized by that
fiend?” she cried, earnestly. “Or is it anything
to my discredit that I should have been
tricked by scoundrels? We are only children,
Aunt Susan! What do we know of
the world? Why, we are both as innocent
as the very field daisies at home, yet you
scorn us for our misfortunes—you ridicule
our sorrow!”</p>

<p>“We cannot afford to get entangled in this
thing, Frederic,” said her aunt, without heeding
her appeal.</p>

<p>“We certainly cannot,” said her husband,
decidedly. “Once for all, Marion, you must
excuse us from meddling in the matter.”</p>

<p>“So you refuse utterly to aid me in my
search for Dollie?” asked Marion, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Frederic Stanton drew a bill from his
pocket slowly and tossed it to her across the
table.</p>

<p>“You can have that,” he said grandly, “but
please don’t count upon me further. My
position in society would be attacked at once
were I to allow myself to be exploited in this
manner.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention our names, for heaven’s
sake!” cried her aunt. “I would die of mortification
if I should see this thing in the papers.”</p>

<p>Without noticing the bill, Marion rose to
her feet. The scorn upon her face made her
relations shrink a little.</p>

<p>“I’m only a country girl—a farmer’s
daughter,” she said slowly, “but, oh, how I
despise such natures as yours! You are a
shame to your sex, Mrs. Susan Stanton, and
as for you, sir, you are not worthy to be
called a man.”</p>

<p>There was not a word spoken as Marion
adjusted her hat.</p>

<p>As she left the apartment she did not even
glance behind her.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE RETURN OF MISS GRAY.</small></h3>

<p>How Marion reached her hotel she could
hardly say, but when she opened the door of
her room she was astonished to find Miss
Gray waiting for her.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you back your clothing,”
she said, with a soft laugh, at the same time
pointing to a valise that was standing on the
table.</p>

<p>Marion had only time to notice that Miss
Gray was attired very simply in black, when
her visitor rose and held out her hand to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Gray, I’m so glad!” cried the
young girl. “I felt sure that you would
come back, but your action was so strange
that I could not help wondering why you
did it.”</p>

<p>“And I knew you would not think ill of
me,” said the woman, smiling, “and it is your
faith in me, Miss Marlowe, that has made me
a different woman. Listen,” she said calmly,
as she drew Marion down beside her, “I
will tell you my story now; but, first, here is
your money.”</p>

<p>Marion took the money absently, and held
it lightly in her hand.</p>

<p>“Do go on with the story, I am impatient,”
she said eagerly.</p>

<p>Miss Gray’s face flushed a little as she
started, but the flush soon died away and left
her composed and natural.</p>

<p>“I am the daughter of a rich man in this
city,” she began, “and I married a man quite
out of my own circle of society. At least, I
thought I was married to him, but the wretch
had deceived me! I found it out when it
was too late. I did not dare to admit it.
Since then I have lived under an assumed
name in this city, although we are supposed
to be abroad. That wretch that you saw last
night was my ‘make believe’ husband!”</p>

<p>“But your father?” asked Marion in
breathless interest. “Would he not take you
back and punish the villain?”</p>

<p>“He would, yes, for he is a noble man,”
was the sad answer; “but my brother and sister
are in society—my sister is engaged to
be married I hear—it would injure them
terribly should my story be known. For
their sakes I have suffered and shall continue
to suffer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is terrible! terrible!” cried her
companion sorrowfully. “But, thank Heaven,
you have been strong enough to leave him at
last! Your life there must have been dreadful!
Oh, how I pity you!”</p>

<p>“A drunken brute is not a very desirable
companion,” said the woman scornfully, “and
oh, the deeds of that infamous man! And
to think that I had to witness them, yes, and
even to protect him in them!”</p>

<p>“You were a martyr to your family. Miss
Gray,” was the soft answer. “I cannot believe
that you did right; still, I must not
judge you.”</p>

<p>“Right! I should say not!” cried Miss
Gray with a flush of shame. “I was his
dupe, his tool! I did not dare to oppose
him! Oh, to think that a woman could fall
so low—why, Miss Marlowe, women came
there and I had to meet them; but, thank
God, I came to my senses in time to save the
innocent!”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget it,” said Marion, softly.
“And now, Miss Gray, I must tell you
my day’s experience.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Gray listened intently as Marion told
her what she had learned. When she finished
she put her arms around her and held her
closely.</p>

<p>“I must leave you now,” she said, after a
little, “for I am planning to leave the country
forever. But you are wondering why I
took your clothes. It was because that I
wanted to disguise myself to get back to my
room unknown to Emile Vorse and get my
few possessions and my money. In your
dress I was able to do it, and I needed your
money to bribe the servants. I expected to
be back before you awoke, but Vorse was
there, and I had to wait until he went out.”</p>

<p>“But will he not pursue you,” asked
Marion.</p>

<p>“I am afraid so. I don’t know what to
do!”</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said Marion. “Let us
cast our lots together! Help me to find my
sister, Miss Gray, and then, if it is necessary,
I’ll change clothes with you forever!”</p>

<p>“You are a brave girl!” cried Miss Gray,
laughing at this allusion to her deed. “My
clothes certainly are becoming to you, dear,
but give me a little time. I will think it
over.”</p>

<p>“He does not know where you are?”</p>

<p>Miss Gray shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then you will not see him,” said Marion,
decidedly. “You will stay with me, I
am sure of it!”</p>

<p>There was a tap on the door, and a bellboy
handed Marion a card.</p>

<p>“A young man whom I met this morning
on the street,” she said, blushing. “I guess
I forgot to tell you that part of my adventures.”</p>

<p>“Ah, a romance, I am sure,” cried the
woman, smilingly. “You are blushing,
dear, your face is scarlet.”</p>

<p>“Come and see him,” said Marion, taking
her friend by the arm.</p>

<p>They walked down the stairs and entered
the parlor. As Mr. Ray rose to meet them
Miss Gray uttered a shriek of horror.</p>

<p>Instantly the young man sprang forward
and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Adele! Oh, Adele! My dear sister!” he
cried. “Poor child, I am so glad to find you
at last! We have all heard your story and
have been nearly crazy about you!”</p>

<p>“You have heard my story?” whispered
Adele Ray, faintly.</p>

<p>“Every word of it, dear,” said the young
man smiling, “and father is only waiting to
get his clutches on that infamous scoundrel,
while—well, see here, sis, I’ve got a
seven-shooter in my pocket!”</p>

<p>He drew an ugly-looking weapon out of
his pocket as he spoke, but as his sister gave
a scream he promptly returned it.</p>

<p>“And you all forgive me?” whispered
Adele, still unable to believe him.</p>

<p>The young man took her in his arms and
kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>“You are as dear to me as ever, sis,” he
said, assuringly, “and every member of the
family is yearning to embrace you.”</p>

<p>“Then you can go home at once,” cried
Marion, delightedly.</p>

<p>Archie Ray gave her a look that set her
heart to beating wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, she can go home at once,” he repeated,
gladly, “while you and I, Miss Marlowe,
go to rescue Dollie.”</p>

<p>Marion thanked him with a glance from
her starry eyes. She appreciated his kindness
keenly—he was a friend indeed in her
hour of trouble.</p>

<p>“I must give you back your pretty clothes,
Miss Gray,” she said, smiling and blushing,
“but I confess I almost dread to get back
into my poor little frock! I am afraid my
brief glimpse of fashion has spoiled me.”</p>

<p>In a very few words Adele Ray explained
about them to her brother.</p>

<p>“I shall never wear them again, pray keep
them,” she urged, as Marion still hesitated.
“They would only remind me of associations
which I must try to forget. Do keep them,
Miss Marlowe, you look so pretty in them.”</p>

<p>Marion blushed, but she shook her head
decidedly.</p>

<p>“I cannot afford to wear them even though
you give them to me, Miss Gray,” she said,
slowly. “I must dress according to my
station in life, and as yet I am only a poor
farmer’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“But surely you are not obliged to wear
homespun when you have something better!
That is false pride, my dear,” said Miss
Gray, stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I wish I could think so, but I can’t,” said
Marion, sighing; “for I do love pretty
clothes. I guess I wouldn’t be a woman if
I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must keep them, anyway,”
said Miss Gray, decidedly. “You’ll get over
those notions some day, and then they’ll
come in handy.”</p>

<p>“She means that you will not be able to
resist putting on the pretty duds,” said Mr.
Ray, who was listening “and I hope you
won’t try very hard to resist, for all women
should dress prettily, it is a part of their
duty.”</p>

<p>Marion smiled, but her eyes were growing
sadder every minute. She was beginning to
wonder if he would like her as well in homespun.
Some way she hated the thought that
he would ever be ashamed of her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Then after a moment her good sense returned.
“It will be a good test for his friendship,”
she thought. “I’ll do it for that reason
as well as the other.”</p>

<p>An hour later Mr. Ray had taken his sister
home and Marion was alone in her room
arrayed in her simple, country garments.</p>

<p>“I’m not so stylish, but I’m much more
comfortable,” she said to her reflection in the
mirror. “How I would look going after the
cows in a long, train dress! Why I couldn’t
jump a fence to save my life, and as for
climbing trees, that would be out of the
question.”</p>

<p>The people in the hotel stared at her a
little the next time they saw her, but as they
were not in the habit of inquiring into the
private affairs of their patrons, she was not
subjected to any special annoyance.</p>

<p>Even in her plain clothing she was strikingly
pretty. There was a grace in her carriage
and a flash in her eye that any queen
on her throne might well have envied.</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<div class="chapter"><h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>MARION DISCOVERS DOLLIE.</small></h3>
</div>
<p>Once more Mr. Ray proved his noble
character. Not by so much as a glance did
he show that he noticed Marion’s changed
appearance.</p>

<p>“Do I look very countrified and dowdy?”
she asked, timidly, when he came for her
that evening.</p>

<p>“You look as pretty as a peach,” was the
young man’s answer. “There’s thousands
of women who would gladly change places
with you—they’d take your clothes if they
could have your face and figure.”</p>

<p>Marion was so embarrassed that she could
not answer for a minute.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are not ashamed of me,”
she managed to say finally.</p>

<p>What Mr. Ray would have answered under
other circumstances Marion could almost
guess, but just then Bert Jackson came in
and put a stop to further conversation of a
confidential nature.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope I am right in my suspicions,”
she said quickly, when they were
on their way to the hall. “I do hope that
Professor Dabroski will prove to be Mr.
Lawson, for, while it is dreadful for my sister
to be in the power of such a monster, still
it will end the suspense which is almost killing
me.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too, for that reason,” was Mr.
Ray’s answer. “It seems remarkable that
you should have found him so soon. The
fellow must be a fool to be so utterly reckless.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he knew my father would never attempt
to rescue Dollie, and there was no
one else. Why, he never even gave me a
thought! I was only a little country girl;
he did not dream that I would follow him!”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t read your character very
well, that’s all I’ve got to say,” said Mr.
Ray, laughing. “Why, my sister says you
would go through fire and water for any one
you loved! You have made a friend of her
for life, my poor wronged sister!”</p>

<p>There were tears very near Mr. Ray’s
lashes now, and it was Marion’s turn to
play the comforter.</p>

<p>“Dear Miss Gray, I loved her almost as
soon as I met her, but I must call her Miss
Ray now—the other name was a disgrace
to her.”</p>

<p>“That scoundrel who deceived her is about
to pay the penalty for his sins,” said Mr.
Ray, slowly. “My father is growing old,
but he has lots of spunk left. Why, he has
already given the fellow twenty-four hours
to leave the country. If he stays, we shall
make it hot for him, I can tell you, and
as for Emile Vorse, the Chief of Police is
after him. It seems that there is enough
against him already to send him to prison!”</p>

<p>“He deserves it,” cried Marion, “the infamous
wretch! No country girl is safe in
a city like this so long as it is infested with
such wolves in sheeps’ clothing.”</p>

<p>When Marion, Bert and Mr. Ray reached
the dingy little theatre they found it nearly
filled with a crowd of ordinary-looking
people.</p>

<p>They went in at once and Marion selected
a seat behind a post, so that she could keep
her face continually in the shadow.</p>

<p>She realized that there was a chance of
her being mistaken, for a bill board picture
is not always over-accurate, and then, too,
she admitted that there was something
strange about the fancied resemblance.</p>

<p>“It was his general contour that convinced
me, not his face,” she said, over and over.
“Mr. Lawson was very dark, but Professor
Dabroski is lighter.”</p>

<p>“That is easily done,” was Mr. Ray’s answer;
“but you must be very certain in your
identification. It would be an awful thing
to accuse the wrong person.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be very careful,” was Marion’s answer,
and then the curtain went up amid
great applauding.</p>

<p>Marion’s nerves were so tense that she felt
like screaming when her first glimpse of the
stage showed it to be entirely empty.</p>

<p>The rough crowd in the theatre began
jeering and whistling, and at last a man
appeared upon the stage and walked directly
to the footlights.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>“Is that he?” asked Mr. Ray, in a trembling
whisper.</p>

<p>Marion shook her head as she scrutinized
the face and figure.</p>

<p>“Professor Dabroski, the greatest living
hypnotist, will demonstrate his power before
you this evening,” began the man, with a
pompous gesture, “and to do this it will be
necessary for him to secure a few ‘subjects,’
which will be picked out indiscriminately
throughout the audience.”</p>

<p>Marion turned and looked at her companion
inquiringly, and Mr. Ray hastened to
explain the fraud contained in this statement.</p>

<p>“He has confederates scattered all about
through the house,” he told her briefly, “but
they’ll make believe that they don’t know
him, just to fool the rest of us. Then he’ll
take them on the stage and make them cut
capers. Of course, some of them are genuinely
mesmerized and some are not, but they
all get paid for their part in the performance.”</p>

<p>“His power is genuine, I am sure,” said
Marion softly. “It was surely a black art
that deceived poor Dollie.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ray looked at her tenderly, and even
pressed her hand in sympathy. To him she
was the personification of all that was pure
and noble.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marion started forward and bit
her lip viciously, while she clenched his hand
with a grip of iron.</p>

<p>A man had come upon the stage attired in
full evening dress. He wore eye-glasses
and was a blonde, but Marion knew instinctively
that it was Mr. Lawson.</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t make a sound—not yet!”
warned Mr. Ray, under his breath.</p>

<p>Marion nodded her head, her eyes were
riveted on the “professor.”</p>

<p>Almost like one in a trance, she watched
what followed; the selection of “subjects”
from the curious audience.</p>

<p>As the professor approached her chair,
Marion drew back cautiously. While she
would have given her all to see him closer,
she was afraid herself of being detected.</p>

<p>“You are a shrewd one,” whispered her
escort; “he did not even see you. Most
women would have stared at him and attracted
his attention.”</p>

<p>The brave girl smiled sadly as she leaned
a little nearer.</p>

<p>“There is too much at stake,” she said
shortly. “I must be more than cautious if
I would save my poor sister.”</p>

<p>One after another of the “subjects” were
“put to sleep” or led into semi-hypnotic conditions
by the professor’s magic. They
danced, sang, recited, in fact, did anything
whatsoever that he wished. Not one seemed
able to move a muscle unless he willed it.</p>

<p>The brave country girl’s heart grew heavy
as she witnessed his power. Her brain
seemed to reel under the full consciousness of
Dollie’s danger.</p>

<p>Suddenly she felt a light touch on her
arm from some one in the rear. She turned
and saw a quiet-looking man leaning carelessly
toward her.</p>

<p>“The detective from headquarters,” whispered
Mr. Ray, in her ear.</p>

<p>Marion smiled and nodded, and the man
moved a little nearer.</p>

<p>“You are sure it’s the chap?” he said, very
softly.</p>

<p>“Certain,” was the girl’s low answer, “that
is Mr. Lawson.”</p>

<p>The man moved away and was lost in the
crowd, and just then Professor Dabroski advanced
to the front of the stage and made
an announcement.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began, in that
voice which Marion knew so well, “I have
given you an exhibition of my power this
evening which must prove conclusively to
every one that I am what the bill boards
call me, ‘The World’s Greatest Hypnotist.’
But before this exhibition is ended, I have
one more proof to give you. I shall now
produce a ‘subject’ whom you have not seen—a
woman who will demonstrate the full extent
of my skill, for she is absolutely unable
to breathe unless I will it.”</p>

<p>There was a roar of applause as the professor
finished, which was stilled as soon as
he raised his hand for silence.</p>

<p>“This is what is usually termed a ‘cataleptic’
condition,” he said, “but you will see that
I control it perfectly, which is more than
can be done by any physician in creation.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>He moved to the rear of the stage and held
out his hand, while Marion half rose in her
seat, her eyes fixed and staring.</p>

<p>Suddenly from behind the scenes a woman
advanced. She was dressed in white and
looked like an angel.</p>

<p>As he led her down to the footlights the
house was as still as the grave; then a shrill,
sweet voice rang out like a bugle peal.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop! He must not do it! That is
Dollie, my sister!”</p>
<hr class="sect" />


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE ARREST AND RESCUE.</small></h3>

<p>For just one brief moment not a sound
was heard; then an echoing shriek broke
from the lips of the “subject.”</p>

<p>“Marion! Oh, Marion! Save me!”</p>

<p>In less than a second the house was in an
uproar. Men and women had sprang from
their seats and were yelling like demons.</p>

<p>Before any one could stop him, Professor
Dabroski darted toward the wings, but while
he was still in full view of his audience, he
was stopped peremptorily.</p>

<p>The detective from headquarters was the
first man to confront him.</p>

<p>“I arrest you for kidnapping,” he said
very plainly. “Here, handcuff him, officers.
We must not take any chances!”</p>

<p>Two officers sprang forward and caught
the professor’s arms, but he was too thoroughly
frightened to make any resistance.</p>

<p>“She is my wife,” he said faintly; “she
is over sixteen!”</p>

<p>A curse from one of the indignant officers
silenced him.</p>

<p>At that instant Mr. Ray sprang upon a
seat and explained the situation. His voice
was clear and distinct, every person in the
house heard it.</p>

<p>A perfect storm of hisses followed his remarks,
and for a moment it looked as if the
entire audience intended making a rush for
the professor.</p>

<p>Cries of “The villain!” “The scoundrel!”
sounded on all sides, for in an instant every
one appreciated the terrible crime he had
committed.</p>

<p>A score of hands were reached forward
and Dollie was lifted straight over the footlights
and placed in the arms of her noble
sister.</p>

<p>As Marion clasped her in her arms, Mr.
Ray and Bert tried to lead the two girls out,
while the crowd, as soon as it saw Dollie’s
girlish, frightened face, yelled with one
voice: “Lynch him! Lynch the rascally
professor!”</p>

<p>The officers hurried their prisoner away
and the detective came back. He had found
Dollie’s hat and gloves and something to
wrap around her.</p>

<p>The crowd made way for them to pass, and
as they passed a mighty cheer went up that
almost shook the building.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the brave country girl!” they
screamed and howled. “Three cheers for the
farmer’s daughter who came to the city to
save her sister!”</p>

<p>Marion wept with delight as Mr. Ray bundled
them both into a carriage, and as for
Dollie, she clung to her sister and cried
both from fear and pleasure.</p>

<p>When they reached the hotel, Mr. Ray
sent a telegram to Joshua Marlowe telling
him briefly of Marion’s success in finding
her sister.</p>

<p>“He will never forgive me,” cried Dollie,
her face burning and scarlet. “He will never
understand that I could not help it! Oh, it
seems like a hideous dream! Can I ever forget
it?”</p>

<p>Marion took her in her arms to soothe and
comfort her, and Mr. Ray bade them good-night
in his heartiest manner.</p>

<p>“You have been so good, so kind to me,”
faltered Marion.</p>

<p>“Who could help it?” was the roguish but
sincerely meant answer. “For you are the
bravest little woman in all the world, for not
only have you found your own, but you
have also restored my darling sister.”</p>

<p>“And there is much more for me to do,”
said Marion, moving away from Dollie for
a moment. “For I have made the charge
of kidnapping against that rascally professor,
and I shall leave no stone unturned to have
him thoroughly punished. The Chief of
Police has told me what to do, but much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>will depend upon what I learn of his treatment
of poor Dollie.”</p>

<p>The two young people looked at each other
with solemn eyes.</p>

<p>“Thank God there are such women in the
world as you,” said the young man soberly.</p>

<p>“And such men as you,” said Marion,
archly.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mr. Ray, the honors are
even. Good-night, Bert.”</p>

<p>Marion took Dollie to her room before
she broke down; then, when the door was
safely locked, she burst out crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, Marion, dear, what shall we do?”
asked Dollie helplessly. “I can’t go home
to father now! Whatever shall we do in
this big, wicked city?”</p>

<p>Marion wiped her eyes and smiled as
brightly as ever.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Dollie!” she said, gayly. “It
is not a wicked city at all! It is perfectly
glorious! And oh, how I love it!”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t intend to go back?” asked
Dollie, relieved.</p>

<p>“Never!” said Marion, stoutly, “or, at least
not if I can help it. We’ll get something to
do, and stay right here, Dollie. There’s a
place for us here, but we’ve got to find it!</p>

<p>“Isn’t it lovely, Dollie?” cried Marion
suddenly. “The superintendent of the lodging-house
has found Bert Jackson a
position!”</p>

<p>Then noticing Dollie’s look she hastened
to explain the exciting episode in Bert’s day.
Her sister was delighted when she heard of
the adventure.</p>

<p>“I just caught a glimpse of him on the
street,” she said, “when that monster, Mr.
Lawson, stepped directly between us. Bert
knocked him down, but he was up in a flash—then
the next I knew poor Bert had been
arrested and he was leading me along—I
could not resist him.”</p>

<p>“You must tell me all, every word,” said
Marion soberly. “I must know the full
length and breadth of that man’s villainy,
Dollie. After that you must try to forget
him, dear! You are safe from him, now—never
again can he harm you! When he is
safely disposed of we shall have enough to
do, for we must go to work to win fame and
fortune.”</p>

<p>Dollie shook her head and a dazed look
crept into her eyes.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, Marion. I am so tired to-night!
To-morrow my head will be clearer
and perhaps I can remember.”</p>

<p>Marion took her in her arms and began
smoothing her hair.</p>

<p>“Just one thing, little sister, and then you
shall go to sleep. Did you take grandma’s
topazes from the old chest, Dollie? I looked
for them one night, but I could not find
them.”</p>

<p>“I took them, yes, dear,” said Dollie
sleepily. “He told me to do it, and I dared
not disobey. There was some reason, I don’t
know what—I always obeyed him.”</p>

<p>“I understand the reason, darling; he had
hypnotized you, but now go to bed, dear, we
will finish our talking to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Marion helped to undress her, soothing
her gently as she did so.</p>

<p>“We will get along famously, I am sure
we will,” she said, cheerily; “for all we need
is perseverance and courage.”</p>

<p>“And you have courage enough for both,”
said Dollie, brightening. “You are the
bravest girl in the world, and I am proud of
you, Marion!”</p>

<p>“I mean that you shall be proud of me
some day,” said the fair girl, slowly; “for if
patience, perseverance and courage count for
anything, I shall be famous, even if I am
only a farmer’s daughter!”</p>

<p>And the beautiful speaker’s words were all
fulfilled, but before she could realize her
highest ambitions there were thrilling adventures
to be passed through and dangerous
pitfalls to be avoided.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her, there were other
charges against Professor Dabroski, and by
the advice of counsel, Dollie’s case was discontinued.
The rascally hypnotist was sent
to Sing Sing for ten years without their appearing
against him, and the two gentle girls
were only too glad to escape the notoriety of
a trial.</p>

<p>As for Deacon Marlowe, he lived to repent
his hardness of heart. The nobility of
his daughters overwhelmed him with shame
and remorse, but it was a pity the lesson
could not have been learned a little earlier.</p>

<p>Archie Ray took his sister abroad at once
to escape unpleasant remarks, but his friendship
for Marion never waned for an instant.</p>

<p>Emile Vorse remained at large for a little
time, but both he and his boon companion—the
wretch who had wrecked Adele Ray’s
life—were caught in the net of the law later
on and both were confined in the same dismal
prison.</p>

<p>Thus the downfall of three villains was
at last effected, and all indirectly through the
heroic courage of a farmer’s daughter.</p>


<p class="center big mt2">THE END.</p>

Marlowe’s Courage; or, A Brave Girl’s

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This department will be made a special feature of this publication. It will be conducted by Miss Shirley,
whose remarkable ability to answer all questions, no matter how delicate the import, will be much appreciated, we feel
sure, by all our readers, who need not hesitate to write her on any subject. Miss Shirley will have their interests at
heart and never refuse her assistance or sympathy.</p>

<p>The following letters are a few which we have received from time to time, addressed to the editors of our different
publications, the answers to which will be found interesting.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Street &amp; Smith.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“My poor mother died in an insane asylum
when I was only a baby. Do you think there is
any danger of my ever becoming insane and
would it be wicked for me to marry?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Eloise T. C.</span>”</p></div>

<p>You are a very sensible and conscientious girl
to ask that question. Yes, it would be very
wicked for you to marry. Do not even dream of
perpetuating such a fearful curse! The person
who, knowing that he or she inherits a blood
taint of any kind, commits a fearful sin when
they marry and propagate the species. It is your
cross to bear. See that you bear it nobly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“So many young girls have had the benefit of
your advice that I feel confident that you will not
be unwilling to help a married woman. When I
married my husband five years ago I thought he
was all that was manly and adorable, and I have
tried to be a good wife. Little by little he has
seemed to grow away from me, and his business
and his men friends monopolize almost all his
time. About six months ago I met a man of my
own age, and since then I have corresponded with
him. My husband is much older than myself, and
I have found pleasure and solace in the letters of
my new-found friend who seems to care for me
deeply. Am I doing wrong to allow myself to enjoy
his acquaintance?”</p></div>

<p>It is evident that you have not been able to
justify yourself in regard to this new friend. You
do not say that your husband has used you
harshly, and his business matters which you complain
monopolize so much of his time are, we
presume, really directed towards your comfort
and protection. It is his business that provides
you with your home and your home comforts. If
it takes too much of his time to do this, why tell
him so. Tell him that you are willing to do with
less if you can have more of him. Let him realize
that his society is more valued by you than pretty
dresses or a handsome house. Many men in their
devotion to their wives and from their desire to
surround them with every possible comfort wear
themselves out with the effort and defeat their
own aims. If your husband is of this type he deserves
the very last atom of your devotion, and
a thought of any one else is more than sinful, for
it is unfair.</p>

<p>As to your acquaintance with the other man,
there is this to be said: When you are morally
bound to another it is neither honorable nor just
to encourage him to take an interest in you. You
will probably do him grievous wrong, even if you
do not do wrong to your husband or to yourself,
which will be hard to avoid. Try to regain your
husband’s interest at once, and decide resolutely
to have none but passing acquaintances. Break
off your correspondence at once, telling your
friend why you do so in a frank, womanly manner,
and you may depend upon it that if he is a
man of worth that he will respect you ten thousand
times more for your action.</p>

<p>Let us hear from you again.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I don’t know of any one to turn to in my
trouble but you, dear Miss Shirley, and I’m sure
you will not refuse me. Both my parents died
when I was a child, and for ten years I have lived
in this little town with my grandparents. I am
nearly eighteen years old, and am beginning to
enjoy men’s society, which my grandparents can’t
seem to understand. They make life miserable
for me with their reproofs whenever I go out
with any of my men friends, and I am tempted
to cut loose from it all. There is one of my
friends who wants me to marry him and go away.
I don’t really love him at all, but he swears he
loves me, and I certainly respect him very much.
Do you think I could be happy with him and
make him a good wife?”</p></div>

<p>You poor little child, not to have had the benefit
of a mother’s advice and fostering care!
There are many like you who have married for
the sake of a home and have found that home—oh,
so unhappy after the novelty and glamor of
the change had worn off. Grace Shirley’s advice
is not to marry for any reason but one—and that
is love. A marriage based on any other reason
must in time prove unsatisfactory. Respect must
go with love, of course, but respect alone is not
sufficient to keep two people together “until
death.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>If you married without loving your husband
you would only make him unhappy because he
would yearn for what you could not give him. To
see him unsatisfied would only dishearten you
and make you even more unhappy.</p>

<p>Wait until the one comes along whom you know
you really love and then decide.</p>

<p>In the meantime try and be friends with your
grandparents, and in a kind way try to make
them realize that you are young and need amusement,
and there is no doubt but what they will
remember that they, too, were young once and
that they will meet you half way.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have read your advice to so many of the
other sex that I hope you will be good-natured
enough to help a man out with his troubles. I
am very much in love with a young lady who, I
am sure, thinks more of me than she does of any
one else, but whenever I talk of marriage she
either changes the subject or else jests about it.
I cannot seem to make her understand that I am
serious. Can’t you give me a word of advice?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Edward.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We are very glad to help Edward or any others
of the sterner sex with their troubles. Very probably
the young woman of your desire realizes
perfectly that you are in earnest, but wants to
become convinced of her own sincerity before she
lets you talk to her seriously about matrimony.
We think she must be a very level-headed young
woman, and if you can win her affection and
marry her you may feel that you have secured a
prize. The girl or woman who is slow to decide
upon so serious a matter as marriage is far more
to be esteemed than those who take the step
hastily and unthinkingly.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Your kind advice to others has made me bold
enough to ask your help for myself, for I am terribly
perplexed. My fiance went to the Philippines
with his regiment over a year ago, and we
have corresponded ever since. Of course, I think
a great deal of him, but about six months ago I
met a fellow who has been awfully attentive to
me and who now wants me to marry him. Do
you think it would be doing very wrong for me
to break off my engagement and marry this other
fellow, who says he loves me very much indeed?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mabel K.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We don’t envy either of your lovers very much,
Mabel. A girl whose nature is as fickle as yours
is not fit to be the fiancee or the wife of one of
Uncle Sam’s brave boys in blue, and if the absence
of one man and the presence of another
works so great a change in your feelings we
doubt whether you would relish Grace Shirley’s
opinion of your actions. We think that your soldier
lover would be well rid of you. The men
who are defending the honor of their country
deserve women of honor for wives and sweethearts—women
whose devotion will not grow less
because of absence, and to whom the attentions
of other men will be no temptation to forget
their lovers over the sea.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“While my betrothed and I are truly fond of
each other, we always quarrel over one subject.
He does not like me to play on the piano at all
when he is here, but wants me to devote all the
time to him. Sometimes I have no chance to
practice during the day, and am obliged to do so
in the evening. As I expect to have to provide
my own pin money at least in this way after
marriage, I do not feel that I should give up my
entire evenings to conversation. Do you think I
ought to do so?”</p></div>

<p>The man who is not able to provide his wife
with pin money has no right to ask a woman to
marry him. Since he has done so, and you have
accepted him, you ought clearly to make him understand
that your cultivation of your talent is
a necessity because of his inability to provide you
with what every woman has a right to expect
from her husband. No woman ought to marry a
man who cannot support her or who expects that
she will have to earn her own pin money. We
are sorry that you are engaged to one of so little
manliness and capacity, and you should think a
long time before binding yourself irrevocably.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I want to ask your opinion on a matter of etiquette.
I am engaged to be married, and, of
course, my lover spends every evening with me.
The other night an old friend called whom I had
not seen for several years, and with whom I enjoyed
chatting very much. My fiance was almost
ungentlemanly, he showed his jealousy so plainly
whenever I addressed a remark to my caller.
Afterwards I remonstrated with him, and he said
I had no right to even talk to other men. Was I
wrong in trying to make myself agreeable to an
old friend?”</p></div>

<p>There is nothing in the world that leads to so
much unhappiness as unreasoning jealousy. If a
woman who has pledged herself to a man deliberately
flirts with others her fiance certainly has
cause for jealousy; but in your case this was not
so. A man who will become jealous at a sociable,
harmless conversation will become jealous without
any cause whatever, and will probably make
his wife miserable through that very trait in his
character. We all need more or less variety in
this stupid old world, and the fact that you are
an agreeable hostess to others does not give your
lover or husband any reason for unjust suspicions.
You will do well to have this plainly understood
before you marry him.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I guess you are tired of hearing about other
people’s troubles, but perhaps you can find a few
minutes for me, for I am certainly in great trouble.
I am deeply in love with a young man
whom I know thinks more of me than he does of
any one else, but who enjoys going around with
other girls, and who says frankly that he will
never marry. Now, I don’t care a bit for any one
else, and I am never happy unless he is with me.
What can I do to gain his entire affection?”</p></div>

<p>We would not advise you to spend your time
trying to gain his entire affection. There is an
old saying about “wasting your sweetness on the
desert air” that would seem to apply in your
case. Why should you spend your time trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>cultivate in this one man’s heart an affection for
you? There are lots of worthy men in the world,
and you will discover them some day. The best
advice we can give you is to cultivate the society
of every man you know and try and discover his
good points. Then you will not find the society
of one man so indispensable to your happiness.
Preserve your own self-respect and you will not
go far wrong. Don’t try to make people think
something of you when they evidently do not
wish to do so.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“My mother scolds me harshly for allowing
young men to kiss me and place their arms about
my waist. We are spending the summer at the
seashore and all the boys and girls carry on more
or less. Is mother right or is she only old-fashioned
and prudish, as the other girls say?”</p></div>

<p>We think this is one of the saddest letters we
ever read. Any girl ought to know that her
mother’s actions are for her good, and that her
mother has her child’s interest at heart even
more than her husband’s. We are sorry that you
thought it necessary to ask our advice, but since
you have you shall have it.</p>

<p>Laxity in manners is never excusable because
one is at the seashore or mountains any more
than if one was on Broadway. You would not let
one of the boys kiss and embrace you on the corner
of Broadway and Twenty-third street, would
you? Well, you want to preserve your dignity
just the same at the seashore. The boys may
make fun of you for a day or two, but they will
respect you a good deal more than they do the
girls that forget to respect themselves. This is
not being prudish or old-fashioned—it is simply
being womanly.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Do you think that a girl can be happy if she
marries a poor man? I am engaged to the nicest
fellow in the world, only he’s poor, ever so much
poorer than my father. I love him dearly and
would marry him to-morrow if I was sure that I
would not miss my home comforts. Sometimes
they don’t seem to amount to anything, and I
feel as if I would be perfectly satisfied, and then
again they seem so necessary to my life. Please
advise me.”</p></div>

<p>The mere possession of money never made any
one happy. Some of our happiest days are when
we have least of this world’s goods. “Kind hearts
are more than coronets,” dear. If your fiance
really loves you and you really love him the loss
of a few unnecessary comforts will not be noticed.
There is no sweeter pleasure in this world than
the pleasures of giving and of going without for
the sake of a loved one. If you love your future
husband enough to feel pleasure at the giving up
of some of your creature comforts you may safely
take the step. On the contrary, if you feel that
you relinquish them unwillingly and feel that you
are going to miss them in spite of the presence of
your husband, then you want to be cautious and
sure of your ground before you decide to marry
at all. A girl who values her own comfort more
than anything else is not a promising subject for
the trials and responsibilities which invariably
accompany matrimony.</p>

<p>Unselfishness is the very first quality necessary
for those who propose to enter wedded life.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I write to ask if it is true that men only desire
to marry rich girls? Is there no chance for a poor
girl who is loving and true-hearted to win a good,
true husband even though she is poor and dependent
upon her own exertions?”</p></div>

<p>Good men are looking for loving and true-hearted
girls the world over just the same as
they have always been. Our correspondent need
not fear that there is no chance for her in the
field of matrimony. A loyal, noble young man
does not seek for a girl to pay the bills, he is both
willing and glad to pay them himself, if only he
can find in her a trusting, faithful companion—one
who can bring joy into his busy life with her
kisses and her smiles. In fact, we believe that
most right-minded young men prefer the honor
of supplying the funds for the family.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“About three months ago I inserted an advertisement
in one of the matrimonial papers and
received a number of replies. Some of them
seemed to be from real nice fellows, and I have
kept up a correspondence with them. One of
them now wants me to go to New York and meet
him for luncheon. It seems to me that it would
be a jolly lark, but one of my girl friends says I
had better not go. Do you think I would run any
risk?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Florence C. R.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your friend is perfectly right and much wiser
than you are. No girl should correspond with
men to whom she has not been properly introduced,
and not even then unless her parents
know of the correspondence and approve of it.
Your anticipated “jolly lark” would likely turn
out to be a most disagreeable episode. The men
that answer advertisements in papers of this nature
are in practically every case scoundrels of
the very worst type. They seek the acquaintance
of young girls simply for vicious purposes, and
any young woman who desires to preserve her
self-respect will avoid them as she would the
plague. We advise you to break off this correspondence
at once, and if you fortunately have a
“big brother” you had better tell him the whole
affair and let him write this would-be “masher”
the sort of letter he richly deserves.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I spent the summer at Asbury Park with an
aunt and a couple of girl cousins. Every day we
met two young men on the bathing beach and I
took quite a fancy to one of them. Now that I
am back home he is very anxious to call on me.
How can I arrange to have him do so? I do not
want to tell my parents how I met him, as they
are both very ‘straitlaced.’</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Isabel.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Acquaintances made at summer resorts sometimes
prove to be very desirable, but are quite as
likely to turn out the opposite. If the young
man’s intentions and character are honorable, he
will no doubt be able to find a way to become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>properly introduced to you and your family. The
manly way for him to act would be to call on
your father and explain who he is, etc. Then let
your father decide whether the acquaintance
shall be continued.</p>

<p>No doubt the young man can find some one
who knows him who is also known to your father
either by reputation or personally, and who
would serve as a proper person to make the necessary
introduction. You cannot be too careful
to preserve the niceties of etiquette in matters of
this nature. Carelessness at the seashore should
not be allowed to lead to license in the city.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“After spending the summer at the seashore I
have returned to the city with my hands and face
as brown as an Indian’s, and all the girls make
fun of me. What can I do to remove the tan?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Dorothy.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Don’t let the girls’ chatter disturb you a bit,
Dorothy. The healthy brown that comes from
exposure to God’s pure air and sunshine is by
no means unbecoming. You could not have any
better evidence of perfect health and good circulation.</p>

<p>Never mind about the girls—the men will
esteem your ruddy skin much more than they
will that of your sallow or pale-faced acquaintances.
There is nothing you can do that will remove
the tan without injuring your complexion.
All bleaches are injurious to the skin and should
be avoided. Nature will remove the tan in her
own good time, but if you want to hasten the
process a little you might use a lemon cut in
half. Rub this into the skin and the mild acid
will help to whiten it. We would advise you to
let the brown alone, however, for there is nothing
that adds more to a young girl’s beauty.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly do me the favor to decide a
question for me? I am sixteen, and I have two

make up my mind which to marry.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Adele.</span>”</p></div>

<p>To tell you the truth, Adele, your letter is a
“startler!” Apparently such a thing as love has
not entered your mind, and yet you calmly insinuate
that you would accept either one of
these young men as your husband. We sincerely
trust that you will “look before you leap.” If
you marry a man whom you do not love you will
lead a miserable existence. Wait until you can
honestly say that you love the man of your
choice. You are too young to marry, anyway, so
you can well afford to wait for him. The question
of money need not weigh heavily in the
balance. Be sure that your lover is able to support
you, for that is absolutely necessary to the
success of any marriage.</p>

<p>We would advise you to devote your time to
study for two years at least, as it is very apparent
that your nature has not yet been refined by
affection.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not think me a silly girl for
asking the following question, but I have heard
so much of the blissful happiness of loving that
I would like to know how I am to tell when I am
really in love. I have met several young men
who made me blissfully happy with their attentions,
but I could not see any difference in my
own feelings. Can it be possible that I really and
truly love them all, or is it that I have never
truly loved? Please answer this question.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span>”</p></div>

<p>We are very much amused at this ingenuous
letter. You are honest, to say the least, and honesty
is one of the greatest of virtues. We do not
really believe that you have ever been in love,
and the word “blissful” in your case means simply
a wrong use of the adjective. When you really
and truly “fall in love” you will recognize the
difference, yet we do not blame you for coming
to us in your perplexities.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“Will you kindly give me your opinion and advice
in the following matter: The gentleman
that I am engaged to has given me a diamond
ring, and as I am a poor girl, working in a store,
my parents say that I should not wear it to business.
My fiance is also a poor clerk, but he saved
enough from his earnings to purchase the ring,
and he says if I do not wear it, it will hurt his
feelings. How can I settle such a perplexing
matter?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Lucy B. A.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Your perplexity is very natural under the circumstances,
but we are inclined to think that
you have a right to wear your sweetheart’s ring,
although we regret that he should have bought
so conspicuous a trinket. Consistency in dress is
always desirable, and we presume the rest of
your costume hardly warrants wearing diamonds.
You had better urge your parents to look at it
differently. No doubt they will try to overcome
their natural repugnance if asked to do so—or,
perhaps, your lover will be willing to exchange
the ring for one more in keeping with your modest
position.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“I have only been married two years, but for
the last six months I have been desperately unhappy.
My husband took to riding a bicycle a
few months ago, and now he spends all his leisure
time off on his wheel. The only time I see him at
home is when he is either cleaning or repairing
the miserable machine. I have a sweet little
baby to take care of, and I can’t find any opportunity
to ride a wheel myself. I don’t want to interfere
with his pleasure, but I would like to receive
more of his attention. Won’t you advise me
how to accomplish this?</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Kittie V. V.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Bicycling is a pastime for which there seems to
be a craze at present, and the best of men are
yielding to the infatuation of the wheel. You
certainly are to be pitied for the loss of your
husband’s society, but we can only advise you to
bear with him patiently and try to show him exactly
how you feel on the subject. Above all, do
not scold or threaten to “smash his old wheel,”
as it will have a tendency to make him “scorch”
away from you forever.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
